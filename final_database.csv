2898,5,I've been wearing this watch for 15 years,"Granted, not the same watch, I've replaced it multiple times over the last 15 years. But with a watch this cheap I don't feel bad doing it. This look is CLASSIC, straight 80's classic and a timeless design still feels of this moment whenever that happens to be.<br /><br />I work as a carpenter so I chew through watches quickly since my hands and wrists are always getting battered around. That being said, they stand up to direct hammer blows and smashing into sheets of plywood or scratching along lengths of steel without any issue. I treat these watches terribly and they keep on telling time perfectly, the backlight never fails nor the alarm.<br /><br />What always fails before the watch does is the band, usually after 1-2 years of daily abuse and taking it on/off to shower the watch band with tear. That or the crystal will become so scratched from accidents that it's time to buy a new one. But who cares! These watches are so affordable I don't mind trading an old, tired one for a brand new one.<br /><br />I love these watches. They look great, they do their job and they're wicked tough.

It's comfortable and versatile, my only issue was that the resin bands can be a little stiff, but they soften (or mold to your wrist) with use.

12559,4,"Great Watch - Accurate - Fairly Rugged - The Strap Is Very Short, Though","I've had a few F91W series watches, and they've all been reliable.  They're so inexpensive, and run so long on the original batteries, they're pretty much disposable.  Over the years, I've bought several of these watches - not to wear on my wrist, but to strap them to my backpack, mount on my bike, and keep in my camp packs.  These are excellent and accurate timepieces to have around, to quickly tell time when your hands are occupied.  Just to try it out, however, I put a new F91W-1 watch on my wrist...  Or, rather, I ~tried~ to put it onto my wrist, but it didn't fit.  I'm not Lou Ferigno or The Big Show, and I could barely touch the tip of the strap to the very tip of the buckle.  I compared it to my older F91W, and it too had a small strap.  A no-name watch from Hong Kong with another &#34;standard men's strap&#34; was a good centimeter longer.  It's not a problem for me, since I don't plan on wearing it, but it's something to keep in mind when purchasing this watch.  As a timepiece, the F91W-1 still great.  Accurate, rugged, water resistant, inexpensive and very plain looking.  I'll trust my life to it as a timepiece, but apparently I won't be wearing them unless I buy a new strap.",[],B000GAWSDG,B09TXZHKLG,AH33K4VDG5O6SIJSWFI73XGYVFHQ,2011-06-28 22:30:22.000,1,True

13036,4,Good Standard Watch,"These are good little watches and I have been using them since they came out 20-30 years ago. I am not sure if the model number has changed but the simple basic Casio digital watch has always been long lasting and dependable. They are not expensive but have served me well. If it gets broken while working or playing I don't worry and I never have to be concerned that someone will rob me for my watch while traveling to other countries.<br /><br />But from a display standpoint it could be better. Although the display is common with all of these style watches, the illumination button is useless. It does not produce enough light or at the correct angle to read the numbers. I since have started using the Casio F-105 Illuminator, same basic watch but with an outstanding back light feature.<br /><br />So if you are looking for a good basic watch with typical features such as 24hr time, alarm, stop watch and large clear digital numbers then this is a good choice.

39170,5,Great for US Military,"I purchased this watch because I've been eyeing this (and it's metal/chrome counterpart) for years now.  This is all of the information I needed on a smartwatch screen.  After my last apple watch bit the dust, I decided to go for an old-fashioned wristwatch.  I am also joining the US Navy and needed a black wristwatch with an alarm - they sell them at basic, but I want to already be familiar with my watch beforehand.  This fit the bill perfectly.<br /><br />For $10, this thing is amazing.  Setting it is a breeze.  You program the month into the watch so it knows how many days there are, so you don't have to reset it monthly like many mechanical watches that show the date.  So you literally just set everything once and you're set.<br /><br />I love how light it is - I'll probably end up sleeping with this thing on.  I am a tall guy and the face is a bit small, however the information is clearly present and easy to see.<br /><br />My only complaint is the light.  It lights up the left side of the screen, but the 1/3 in the middle and 1/3 to the right are still pretty dark.  I can use the light and see the info okay in the dark, so it does serve its purpose.  It could be better though, but this is where I'm like ""I paid $10 for this thing"", so over all not an issue.<br /><br />DEFINITELY recommended.  May not be pretty, but I've always been a ""function over fashion"" sort of person, and this watch is amazing.<br /><br />Highly recommend, especially if you need something for military service.",[],B000GAWSDG,B09TXZHKLG,AHGUGWO57HSW4I3UHD24FVTCQUDQ,2020-12-03 17:41:08.431,0,True

So only the first number is well lit, and you have to look very closely and very hard in order to see / guess what the other numbers are.<br /><br />This watch could have gotten 5 stars if not for the crappy illuminator.

The F91W-1 uses a single LED for its lighting source, which is pretty weak. Note some of the complaints in these comments about the poor backlight quality. On the other hand, the F105W-1A uses an electroluminescent backlight, which is a far better uniform, bright backlight. It's blue, too. Hence its name of &#34;Illuminator.&#34; Other than that, the two watches (and their bands) are identical. It's like comparing a lightbulb (Classic) to a glowing wall (Illuminator).  BTW: both watches use an 18mm band.<br /><br />So if the quality of the backlight is of concern to you, pop for the extra $3 and buy the Illuminator instead of the Classic.

Th F91W is a classic. It's remained virtually unchanged for decades, and there's a reason for that. Certainly, it has its own look. It's slim, sleek, and sports the cleanest of clean lines. It's simple, and it doesn't make a big fuss. It's comfortable, it's accurate, and it does enough. Its alarm is positively reliable, and its stopwatch is simple and consistent. It's small and unassuming, and doesn't draw a lot of attention to itself because it doesn't need to. This watch exists for its wearer and no one else. It doesn't try to impress, but it will never let you down. It does a few things and it does them well, all the while, not pretending to care at all about the things it doesn't do.<br /><br />It's a perfect watch for a woman or a man, for a child or an adult. It's good for sport, and it's good for relaxing, and it's good for work, and it's just fine for everything else in between.<br /><br />If this watch were a person, when asked the time, it would reply &#34;quarter to three!&#34; with a big grin on its face, and go back to its drink without missing a beat. It wouldn't huff and fumble for the time and act as if you were intruding on it before somehow giving you a time that was an hour too fast or slow.<br /><br />But you knew that already, didn't you? It used to be that you could find an F91W accidentally, just out shopping in the department stores. And maybe you'd need a new watch so you'd pick one up. But today, and especially online, the F91W doesn't really find you as much as you go looking for it. You wouldn't be looking at it if you didn't already know it was perfect for you.

I had an awful time trying to take the stiff posts off the time piece, as it wouldn't slide out and did not have the spring collapsible post that is much easier to remove and install. It was extremely difficult to push or slide the posts out of the holes. As a result I had to bend the post to get it off. After finally getting it off the time piece, I straightened the post and struggled to install my preferred watch band. To add insult to injury, the light did not cover the entire time piece and I could see only the hour numbers and not minute numbers in the dark.

215087,5,Perfect minimalist watch,"I own about a dozen Casio digital watches (I'm kind of a collector) and this one is tied with my G-Shock DW-5600E as being my favorite.  Casio makes and sells tons of F-91 watches for a reason, and have done so for a long time. The beauty of this watch is that it is so light and thin that it almost becomes a part of your body and you forget that it is on your wrist. At the same time the F-91 is quite accurate, reliable, and sturdy considering it's super low cost. Even if it does break, which would require significant abuse, the low price means getting a new one is painless. The batteries on these things will last a good long time. As far as accuracy, my F-91 actually does much better than my DW-5600E. The style isn't for everyone but I personally love the retro look. The only down side is that you don't want to be caught in a warzone wearing one because ownership of an F-91 could get you accused of being a terrorist bomber and sent to Gitmo.

I'd say I have an average to small wrist at 7.5&#34; circumference... so if you have a large wrist this band will be too small.... However after a few days I begin to appreciate the stripped down efficacy of this $9 purchase.<br />However, the watch's face is smaller than I would like.  It almost feels like a woman's sport watch.  I just purchased a Timex T5K086 1440 Sports band and found the Timex much more suitable.  The face is much larger than the casio and definitely more suited to a man.  The ease of setting up date and time is a bit more difficult than the Casio.

IT STILL IS RUNNING ON THE SAME BATTERY IT CAME WITH.  The strap is still flexible, the holes not stretched, the metal etc... all have taken a beating and it keeps on working.<br /><br />My old Casio finally died after maybe 15 years... and I didn't want to spend a lot on a expensive new watch so took the plunge with this one... figured it was inexpensive enough to toss if it didn't work.<br /><br />When I first got it - in fact, it didn't work.  I fiddled with it, pushed every button, and finally opened it to make sure there was a battery in it... yup, there was... so fiddled with it a bit more and when nothing worked I figured I'd take it to the landfill at some point so I chucked it into a  jar full of old batteries for recycling.<br /><br />A few weeks later I dug it out & gave it one more chance which included smacking it on my desk top - hard.  !!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />IT BEGAN WORKING and has worked since!

314136,5,It’s still ticking after a couple of months use.,"My son LOVES his watch. He’s 5 years old and has been asking for a watch since he was 3. I promised I’d get him one when he learned his numbers. Well, I forgot, or was hesitant to invest in something that wouldn’t last, and he had to remind me for a year later. And here we are!  I’ve made the mistake of getting watches with the characters on them.  (I’m looking at YOU Lego and Pokémon.)  We’ve bought wannabe G-Shocks. We’ve been through at least 6 watches with my 2 older kids and they never lasted more than a couple of months.  (Hesitancy merited!). I took a break from watch shopping because I just didn’t want to pay a lot for a kids’ watch that wasn’t going to last.  But my 5 year old “needed” a watch!  He wanted a cool, big boy looking watch. I bought him an Armitron since it was a good name and we found a style he liked, and it wasn’t too pricey. The watch ended up being too big and we gave it to our 13 year old. (It’s lasted for a couple of months so far.) This brought me to the Casio. It’s bare bones, slim, water resistant, has the date and time, an alarm, and stop watch. It’s so easy to use my son can adjust the date and time on his own. He used to sleep with it under his pillow and would put it on every morning. Now he sleeps with it on but loosens it so his skin can “breathe” at my behest. He tells everyone about his watch. It’s endured more than a couple of months so far. Fingers crossed to Casio still being quality.<br /><br />The pics include a size comparison of this Casio and the Casio Men's W800H-1AV Classic Sport Watch with Black Band, and the Armitron Sport Men's Digital Chronograph Resin Strap Watch, 40/8284. They fit my 5, 11, and 13 year old boys well, respectively.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B13uChpclYS._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B13uChpclYS._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B13uChpclYS._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B1D3UIhFJLS._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B1D3UIhFJLS._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B1D3UIhFJLS._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B1k08AEVLOS._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B1k08AEVLOS._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B1k08AEVLOS._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B000GAWSDG,B09TXZHKLG,AFTTE6424FHQLSQFBJ7ZV5MC4ZEQ,2021-04-02 05:15:48.319,3,True

The day and date feature is another great one to have, as it saves the guess work of remembering what day of the week and date of the month I am currently on.  This comes especially in handy when filling out and completing paperwork.<br /><br />The band is very comfortable to wear, my only recommendation is an occasional cleaning as it has a tendency to accumulate residue from dead skin and sweat, which can lead to an uncomfortable rash if not otherwise addressed.",[],B000GAWSDG,B09TXZHKLG,AGPQA57YMWS2JA56DYVTH6QSXGHQ,2016-07-29 19:01:04.000,0,True

351570,5,Great watch at a great price,"The first time I ever got a F91W1 was when I was in the 10th grade. My grandfather gave me this watch because I was planning on going on a 22 day Alpine back packing trip in the Sierra Nevada and would need a watch. This watch was perfect. Over the course of my trip, I went swimming in waterfalls, freezing cold lakes and rapids. The watch was resistant to water damage through and through. Not a day went by that I didn't wear the watch. I slept with the watch every night and by the end of the trip, I had a watch tan lol. Unfortunately, I lost the watch when I came home. So I bought a new one about 5 months ago from Amazon. This new watch is great and doesn't have any of the wear that my old one had (duh). The old one definitely had a lot of character to it but this one is just as awesome, for a great price too! The watch is also pretty fashionable amongst my peers. I always hear compliments about it.

408520,4,A very solid every day watch. Pretty small though.,"I went with this watch because I was previously using a smart watch daily, but was growing tired of constantly having to charge it and having it run out of battery. When I first received the watch, I was a little surprised with how small it was. The face of the watch is just under the size of a quarter (see the attached picture), so if you're on the bigger side, this might look really small on you. The wrist strap included, as I can't imagine it being comfortable on those who have bigger wrists.<br /><br />The watch itself is comfortable, and I barely notice that I'm wearing it. It is easy to read during the day, and I have found the month / date feature to be super useful as I'm constantly forgetting what day it is. Setting the watch is really easy, and I like that you can easily switch between 24 hour and 12 hour mode.<br /><br />The built in light is just OK. The light really only lights up one side of the watch which can make it a challenge to read at night if your eyes aren't adjusted.<br /><br />All in all, not too much to complain about given the price point. If those things aren't deal breakers for you, the watch is a really solid value, and great for every day wear.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61SXh92g2JL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61SXh92g2JL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61SXh92g2JL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61XlMZFxlsL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61XlMZFxlsL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61XlMZFxlsL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61z2BJodcZL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61z2BJodcZL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61z2BJodcZL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B000GAWSDG,B09TXZHKLG,AHVQR7U4PJ7VTG36DQMRSIHK7O6A,2020-10-29 15:04:01.404,6,True

However, somehow this watch being a digital watch, the digital screen is  kind of small, it wasted a lots of usable space on the dial, and the digital time is hard to read unless you hold it up close, the band barely fit my 7 inch wrist, and the night light is totally useless, so dim-you wonder why bother, overall, you are probably better off buying the the older Casio digital watch with the bigger read out and of course not the oversized Casio they offer today especially in the G-Shock category. l always wonder why can they just make a smaller G-Shock for men, I would buy one for sure.",[],B000GAWSDG,B09TXZHKLG,AGGUJWRSLDPJ3D4CXMWWA5FUHTHQ,2021-02-08 19:39:19.095,1,True

591171,5,Perfect!,Purchased this 5 months ago because I needed a cheap yet durable watch to wear every day. The simplicity of the design also makes for a beautiful  watch that goes with my usual everyday college student attire. The night light is also handy for checking the time in a dark environment like a movie theater or simply walking around at night on campus. I also like that it has the date and the day displayed on the watch face for the days that I forget what day it is. I bought the men's watch rather than the women's because in my experience the women's watch face is usually small and the band is too thin. It is also very light and don't feel it on my wrist once it is on.

I've taken this down to 45 meters below sea level and it still lights right up and tells you that it's 3PM.  If you do somehow manage to break it, by running it over with a train or something, it costs $10 to replace.<br /><br />After a few years the strap broke while I was in Vietnam and I couldn't find a genuine Casio to replace it and ended up paying $12 ($2 more than the cost of a real one with shipping!) for a fake one so I could swap out the strap.  Both the fake and the strap broke a few weeks later.  I wasn't ready to give up on this guy, and managed to get a genuine replacement strap in Kuala Lumpur for $5.  Yes, I could have just bought 2 new ones from Amazon for the combined cost of the replacement parts, but that's beside the point!

I made sure not to shower in the watch to prevent the moisture build-up, but the humidity alone - and perhaps very minimal splashing from hand-washing? - caused moisture to sneak into the watch face. I am very upset that I cannot wear this model any longer and will have to find an alternative that is more water resistant.

And maybe I just assumed that it was waterproof last time, but I now notice that it says &#34;Water Resistant&#34; on the back of the watch, so my bad for taking it into the ocean!

768773,5,LOVE LOVE LOVE IT. Amazing watch!,"Good:<br />Have had this watch for about two weeks and I LOVE it. It is EXTREMELY light weight (almost impossible to feel on your wrist unless you have it so tight it is cutting off circulation which you shouldn't be doing anyway). If it is tightened properly, you cannot feel it. The time is easy to read. The band is plastic, meaning it is waterproof and you don't have to take it off to wash your hands (like I was having to do with all my leather bands and getting annoyed). Also shows the day and the date, which is super helpful during a hectic work week when everything starts to blur together.<br /><br />Has a retro 1980s vibe that is totally in right now with Stranger Things and hipsters and I've gotten a lot of compliments on it. Somehow, after all of these features, the watch still costs only $9. Thus, I offer this watch up as the very best value in any watches anywhere. I thought my $20 Timex was a good value, but after buying this watch the Timex just sits in my drawer since it seems so comparatively heavy, high maintenance (canvas band that starts to smell funky after a few weeks and needs watching). I wear this watch daily and get a weird kick out of putting it on. The best $9 I have spent in a long time. Has an aesthetic that is 100% functional/pragmatic, which just makes it a fun thing to use. I wish I had purchased this watch YEARS ago. I am excited about using this watch to backpack since I am not afraid about it being stolen, quickly tells me the time (digital), won't absorb odors or show dirt, and weighs nothing.<br /><br />Bad:<br />The one thing I wish this watch had was an Indiglo feature like Timex watches have, since the light up feature on this watch is sufficient to see, but not nearly as nice as Timex Indiglo.",[],B000GAWSDG,B09TXZHKLG,AFA46CKDWGDQ5JCQAFATPT3SND3Q,2017-12-23 15:55:48.953,31,True
768775,5,90's Nostalgia and a Great Watch for Only $12,"I wore a Casio F-91W watch in the 90's and I loved it as it fit perfectly under a dress shirt but also worked so well as a casual watch, and it was indestructible.  It never needed a battery and kept perfect time for many years.  Eventually the band broke and by then, my cell phone told the time and I stopped wearing a watch.  I got back into watches 8 years ago and I now have a small collection.  I had completely forgotten about the F-91W until I saw it online recently.  Wow, Casio has been making the same watch since 1989!  It is new and retro at the same time.  I ordered one as soon as I saw it and I absolutely love my new one.  It is 1990 all over again and the price of nostalgia was a mere $12.  It is smaller and lighter than I remember (but that is probably because modern watches are large and heavy).  It is a pleasure to wear as most of the time I forget I have it on my wrist.  You can pay thousands of times more for a watch but this is all you need if you just want a dependable watch that will accurately tell you the time.  Everyone should have a F-91W in their collection, no matter if you only own one watch or you own a thousand.

808342,5,Amazing watch for $10.,"I have had my F-91w for several years. My son also has one. You’ll see that my positive comments are similar to those of other reviewers:<br />- Comfortable and almost weightless. Feels like it’s not there.<br />- The perfect set of features for a digital watch: Time; 24-hr (military) time; optional hourly beep; optional daily alarm; stop watch w/ 1/100th of second timing; light.<br />- According to Casio, this is not really a water resistant watch— splashes only, I believe. However, my son & I have worn ours swimming in fresh water and salt water dozens of times, often for over an hour at a time. No damage at all.<br /><br />My only complaint: The light. Back when I owned my early Casios (mid-1980s), the “backlights” were dim and weak yellowish lights that shone from one side of the display and almost didn’t light up the opposite side of the display. That’s how this light is.  This weak feature might not matter to you, but I sleep in my watch and am in the habit of looking at it if I wake up at night.  The light almost doesn’t light up the whole face.  If the watch’s light is important to you, consider the Casio F-105, which is the same exact watch (size/shape/features) as the F-91w, but for $3 more gives you a blue light that illuminates the entire screen uniformly. I have another Casio watche with this type of light and it’s amazing. So if the weak light doesn’t matter, get this for $10. For a much better light, get the F-105 for $13.",[],B000GAWSDG,B09TXZHKLG,AHJ7HBMRMDPRKCVNYWBV65MZ5JOQ,2018-03-05 00:19:16.516,4,True
808361,5,A True Classic.  The Patek Philippe of Digital Watches,"This is probably the most practical watch one can own.  Great job Casio!<br /><br />I do not understand the current trend of “cookie on a strap” when it comes to watches. You really want an 8 ounce watch made from steel salvaged from a sunken ship? This watch confidently bucks that trend both in size but also in practical value. The F91 is for those with more brains than money.<br /><br />If you take a look back in watch history when watches were made to tell time and not function as high fashion, watches were smaller.  The common man sized watch was about 35mm wide.  Guess how wide the F91 is, yup, about 35mm wide.  Do you suppose there might have been a reason watches were smaller?  Perhaps weight and comfort?  Ever try wearing one of the “cookie on a strap” watches with a long sleeved shirt or with gloves?  As Dr. Phil would say, “how’s that working out for you?”.<br /><br />The F91 fits under shirts easily and doesn’t catch on the cuff.  It’s so light you forget it’s on your wrist, unlike a Seiko monster I once owned that I could not wait to take off.  After you have forgotten it’s on your wrist, no reason to baby it.  It’s water resistant and will survive getting knocked around just fine.<br /><br />Unlike our smart watches of today, battery life is measured in years, not hours.  I can’t believe I didn’t get one sooner and I can’t believe people by watches that won’t run more than 18 - 24 hours without a power source to charge the battery.  That’s not progress, that’s regress.

Doesn’t take much to learn how to set and use it. Its simple functionality is why it’s become a favorite in my watch collection.<br /><br />Thirty something millimeters is a bit on the small side, but it’s not so bad. It still has presence regardless of its small case, and super light weight. Yea, once you have it on, you could forget you’re wearing it.<br /><br />The resin strap isn’t the best. I expect to replace it sooner rather than later. The backlight is a joke. Could barely read the display in darkness, but it’s clear and legible otherwise.<br /><br />I’m not gonna vouch for the WR.

812534,5,A great reliable inexpensive retro style watch,"I bought this watch at a big box store roughly a year ago for just over $15.00. I previously owned similar watches like this one back in the 80s. It is a fine inexpensive and nice retro digital watch. It is accurate and loses maybe 15 seconds or so each month. The low gloss gray silver case finish and face black strap give it a nice clean monochromatic look. It is easy to read. The back light shines from the left and is dim on the minutes digits in less than pitch black rooms but reads easily in very dark rooms and areas. It can be worn for almost any occasion but would seem best suited for daily wear, to work, recreation, exercising, in the garden, working on the car, etc. If it is used in situations where it is bumped into walls or objects it will scuff and scratch the case easily. The comfortable plastic strap is nice and when it wears out it can be replaced with an inexpensive Nato strap or could even be replaced with a new F-91W watch altogether at this low price.

828786,5,Casio digital watches are always reliable. F91W has the green firefly light.,"I have been buying the Casio Digital watches since the 1980's. I won't wear any other kind of watch. The resin bands are so comfortable and smooth to wear. Forget other watches that have that steel stretchy band that grabs and pulls the hair on your wrist. Casio watches don't do that.  If your resin band cracks or breaks, you can always buy another band from PerFit, according to the model number of your watch, from Amazon or directly from the Casio company.<br />  I now prefer this Quartz digital F-91W model because it is always available and it has what I call a green &#34;firefly&#34; light you can turn on to see what time it is in the darken movie theater. This model IS water resistant. There is an alarm you can set to the time you want it to beep. This watch is always correct to +/- 30 seconds per month. You can always reset the time of this watch down to the very second. There is an alarm you can set to beep every hour (choice of on or off) and set to an exact time. Choose 12-hour or 24-hour (military) reading. Auto calendar you can set day and date. You can even set it to &#34;Leap Day ' (2-29).<br />  Be sure to read the instructions to setting your watch for the first time before you wear it. Instructions are printed in English and 3 other languages.<br />  Includes one-year warranty.<br />  Add this Casio watch to your Amazon Wish List so you can buy another one for yourself or as a gift.

849409,5,Tried and True Design,"I wanted to try this watch for two reasons: one is that I have a hard time finding a watch that doesn’t look extra large on my extra small wrists. The other is that I wanted something cheap I can wear while I’m at work (restocking large heavy boxes) without care of it getting scuffed. It handles both of these tasks fairly well so far! The hourly chime has actually been a lot nicer than I thought it would be for work cause it reminds me of any tasks that need to be completed. I just turn off the chime when I return home so it doesn’t go off and drive me crazy when I’m trying to go to bed! The alarm is nice and I wake up to it and I use it as a back up to my phones alarm clock. The backlight works perfectly fine for my needs as I’m usually using it in the middle of the night and I’m wondering how long it has been since I started to try to fall asleep and I go “really, That long?!” It has gotten a few scuffs over the course of work, but nothing that’s too noticeable/in your face and with a watch like this I think the scratches just adds to its character. I have been caught in the rain and have Had times when I had to wash my entire arm along with the watch and it has held up to all the soaking though I don’t know how it would hold up in complete submersion. The main selling point is the price though and for all that it can do I will definitely be looking into more Casio products in the future when I am looking for quality at a reasonable price.

However the last one I purchased, it was IMPOSSIBLE to replace the band. Not sure if the pin system is different but I ended up destroying the side of the watch and cutting myself in the process. Never had this issue before. The finish on the new one seems to be a matte finish, different from my old one. Will try and return but again.. this thing is destroyed after an hour of trying to swap the band. Got one side 50% attached and the other side I could not.<br />*** Update. 2 days of tinkering with it and I finally attached the new band. Wouldn't let it beat me.

Fits his wrist well (on one of the tightest settings), so I can see how some have complained that the band is too small.  The face of the watch is just the right size -- not too big, not too small.  He loves to be able to compare his watch with all the clocks in his school.  It also helps him stay on task for specific amounts of time.  One day, he accidentally switched it to military time, which caused him some temporary panic (&#34;It says 14:30! It's broken!&#34;), but that became an opportunity to learn about the 24-hour clock.

953549,5,Worn every day for 2 years AND abused,"First things first, it is hard for me to find a watch that doesn't look bulky on my small wrists, and this watch achieves just that. The face is small enough to fit comfortably on my wrist without being too big or small. That being said, I've had this watch for almost two years and it's still kicking. I've abused this thing, brought it in the ocean, in pools, I've scratched this thing up from carrying a skateboard, I've thrown this watch everywhere, I've slammed it down on various surfaces, I brought it to a summer camp, and it still holds up. The gold paint does wear away over time, but that's probably a result of the way I wear it (with the face on the inside of my wrist) so it rubs against everything. It still looks fine without the gold paint because the plastic underneath is an off-white color. The strap is still going strong, no cracks or tears or any signs of weakness. I wear this watch every day and I've done that for the past two years and I thoroughly believe that this watch will last a lot longer than that. It tells you everything you need to know, the time, and the date. Warning: You WILL have to change the date after February because it doesn't account for the missing days. No big deal though, this watch is so simple that you can change anything on the face of it in just a few seconds.

960626,5,Perfect basic watch,"***Year update: Still rocking this little thing. It's looking a little worn, but I don't baby it. The plastic that the strap is pinned into actually somehow broke one night. I was devastated, but I was able to superglue it back together and it's held together since (~about 6 months now). My only complaint is that mine gains time at about a rate of about 3 seconds/week. Nothing terrible considering the price, but it's painfully obvious when I compare it to the Wave Ceptor (my atomic time keeper)<br /><br />I'll preface this buy disclaiming that the main reason I bought this watch was because of all the jokes about it being linked to.... less savory types. However, I did need a cheaper watch than my Wave Ceptor that I wouldn't mind wearing every day and wouldn't care about keeping it looking nice. This watch fits the bill. It's very lightweight and fits my small wrists without a problem. It has all the basic functions you can want out of a digital watch and has an almost timeless look to it. The display is easy to read and the light is nice and bright in the dark. My only complaint is that is you enable the hour beep, it's rather loud. It was a feature I was looking forward to using, but I don't want to disturb people around me so it remains turned off.

1031525,4,Economical and accurate watch,"This review is in two parts: First, the timepiece itself is reasonably accurate and the battery does last a long time. The only design flaw is the omission of a month display. Sure, most of us know what the current month is, but why not also have it digitally displayed beside the day of month on the face of this watch?<br />The second part of review is the strap that comes with this watch. These straps are made from a man-made material that slowly grows more and more brittle over time. It will eventually break, guaranteed. This usually happens near the point where the left and right straps buckle together. The watch itself will outlast the original strap plus a couple of replacement straps. I have a supply of perfectly good digital watches still keeping time, but now sitting in a storage drawer because I can no longer find suitable straps. Even if I could, they are nearly as expensive as a brand new watch. So, I purchase another $12 Casio watch because they are good for everyday use.<br />Speaking of straps: the strap on this watch is awful. The reason for this is the loop that secures the end of strap in place after putting watch on your wrist. The loop is floating, that is, it is not fixed in any one position on the strap. This causes it to move out of position and no longer keeps end of strap secured. That means the strap is forever catching on everything and forcing the watch to rotate around on your wrist.

I saw the Casio F91W-1 and - for around $10 - figured it might just do. I wore that watch every day, in 100+ degree work environments. I wore it when I shoveled ton after ton of sludge by hand. I wore it when I scraped out the filter press. I wore it when I loaded sulfuric acid gel into the mixers (and I have the acid burn scars to prove it) and it took everything I threw at it without missing a beat. It even kept good time. This watch has taken everything I threw at it from the day I bought it and just keeps going. It’s not pretty, no. But it is cheap, reliable and tough. It’s a medium size watch, so it doesn’t take up much real estate on your wrist and it’s so light you barely feel as if you have it on. It’s water-resistant enough for everyday use - no need to worry about getting caught out in the rain. You can even shower with it on, but I’d probably draw the line at scuba diving. For roughly $10, it’s pretty tough to beat for someone looking for practical timekeeping, and who isn’t concerned with the latest fashion.",[],B000GAWSDG,B09TXZHKLG,AFZEHA6KKHSWQNDNAS2C2ZTX7QVA,2015-05-08 18:54:39.000,0,False

1065744,4,Great Watch with a Classic Design,"I had been looking for a relatively cheap digital watch, preferably from Casio, as a simple watch to start the New Year off with. When I searched &#34;casio digital watch&#34; this was about the second product listing, so I knew it had to be a decent watch. I had worn it for a day or two and have since replaced it with the [insert link here]. Here is my review of the Casio F91W-1 and an explanation of why I replaced it.<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Design & Build:<br />For just over $10, this Casio has great build quality and a cool retro design. In fact, the Casio F91W has been produced since 1991 and even has its own Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casio_F-91W) page! The design of the Casio is simple and classic and is probably one of the reasons why this watch is still successful after 25 years! The watch is very thin, - only 8 millimeters - especially for a digital watch, which is about the same thickness as an iPhone 5. The watch face is made of plastic and is not recessed into the body, meaning that while it is flush with the casing it can be scratched easily. The casing of the watch is made of resin which is pretty standard in most digital watches. The band is also made of resin and is comfortable enough for a $10 watch. One complaint that I have about the watches build quality is the material of which the band buckle is made of. The band buckle is made of ordinary black plastic which I can see breaking in a year or two. While I can't vouch for the longevity of this watch, I can almost confidently say that that plastic buckle will be the first part to break. Other than that, the watch features nice easy-to-press buttons which stick out from the watch a millimeter or two. The buttons are very easy to press, which can be both a good thing and a bad thing as they might be pressed accidentally. The top left button activates the display light which is very weak and only lights up from one side of the display, meaning that the left part of the display is kind of bright while the further you get to the right side of the display the light dims drastically. This seems like one of the areas Casio had to cut corners with in order to cut the cost, however, it is only a minor complaint with a $10 watch. The light shines a green light and only turns on while the button is depressed, which is kind of annoying. Digital watches I have owned in the past stayed on for a few seconds, but again, this is only a minor complaint with a $10 watch. Finally, the Casio features water RESISTANCE, not waterproofing, therefore I wouldn't go swimming with it, however, other users have reported diving with it so the decision is ultimately up to you. Overall, the Casio F91W features a simple and timeless design, as well as pretty good build quality for $10. The display light has some issues and the watch is only water resistant, but these things don't matter too much in a $10 watch.<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Fit:<br />I have around a 6-inch wrist and this watch fit great. I used a hole more towards the end of the band away from the case and it fit comfortably while not being too loose. The watch is very light and once it is on you almost forget it is there. The case is also thin and doesn't add much bulk to your arm. For me, the watch face was a good size proportionate to my wrist. It might have been a little small for my liking but it definitely didn't get in the way. Overall, I am happy with how the F91W fit on my wrist.<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Overall:<br />This watch is a great watch for the price. While I can't vouch for the longevity of this watch, I can say that it features a great design and decent build quality, as well as a good and comfortable fit (at least for my wrists). To conclude, if you have a bit over $10 to spend on a digital watch, you really can't go wrong with the Casio F91W.<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Pros:<br />- Classic simple design<br />- Decent build quality<br />- Comfortable<br />- Thin and light<br />- Easy-to-press buttons<br />- Good fit for me<br />- Accurate time-keeping (Casio claims that the watch is accurate to ±30 seconds per month due to the quartz movement of the watch)<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Weak plastic band buckle<br />- Easily scratched plastic face<br />- Weak and poorly designed display light<br />- Buttons may get accidentally pressed<br />- Only water resistant<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Why I Replaced it:<br />Even though the Casio F91W is a great watch for the money, I decided I wanted something a bit nicer, even if it meant spending a little bit more money. After browsing Amazon for other Casio watches, I came across the [[ASIN:B000AR7S3A G-Shock G100-BV Men's Black Resin Sport Watch]]. The reason why I replaced the F91W isn't because it isn't a good watch, instead, I replaced it because I wanted something a little nicer with a more rugged design. To conclude, I replaced the F91W not because it wasn't good, but because of personal preference.<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />If you found this review helpful I would appreciate it if you clicked the &#34;helpful&#34; button below this review.

1117362,5,Much like in the age of early man,"In this day and age ‘greatness’ is a term used too often and too frequently, to truly achieve greatness one must bring things back to first principles. Much like in the age of early man, the importance of measuring the passing of time, the arc of the sun and moon across the sky and the changing of seasons has been core to surviving, thriving and dominating, and, in the F91-W we have the essence of the 200,000 year journey mankind has made. When man’s time on earth has passed, the F91-W will remain, keeping time in dutiful simplicity, abiding by its key tenets of dependability, timelessness and quartz precision. Other watches may come and go and, like the trappings of youth, you might be tempted to look to the glitz and shine of a gold Rolex. For this affliction I’d recommend the F-91WM-9ACF Casio Men's 'Classic' Quartz Metal and Resin Casual Watch, color: gold. Once the F91-W is on your wrist you will notice the subtle but definite shift of your stress levels, sort of like the soothing feeling of writing on a banana with a ball point pen. Who do I recommend the F91-W for? Well, simply the person who wishes to have a watch that tells the time, especially in dark environs that call for a subtly lit time check instead of the retina-frying, ‘distant explosion’ light flare of an iPhone screen. Imagine being able to time check the remaining run time of a big screen movie without lighting up the entire theatre? Imagine never having to worry about charging a device you carry with you every single day? Imagine being able to take that device with you even into the shower? Imagine that, even if you break it (which is difficult to do), you need not fear the cost of the loss, nor the time lost trying to navigate an appointment with the Apple Store to fix the ‘gorilla glass’ (which let’s face it should be re-named ‘delicate flamingo’ glass). Imagine that nobody will even notice you are wearing a watch or even consider mugging you for it and imagine that you can get all this for the princely sum of $10.35 (at time of writing). Well, imagine no more because, in the words of famed 2005 Sydney Swans Premiership Coach Paul Roos, “HERE IT IS!”.",[],B000GAWSDG,B09TXZHKLG,AHLK5EAUOVQVBXSDWKNKSOGZ76BQ,2018-08-23 03:25:19.645,126,True

1155932,4,My favorite watch,"This watch is almost perfect.  It is thin, comfortable, legible, accurate, durable, and stylish.<br /><br />It measures 9mm thick, which looks bigger on a ruler, but feels great on your wrist and is lighter than most other watches.<br /><br />The problems were that it did not ship with the box pictured; it came in a plastic bag in an envelope, and that the light on it only illuminates from one side, casting an dim and uneven light.  For this reason, I think that the [[ASIN:B000GB1RAU Casio Men's F105W-1A Illuminator Digital Watch]] is a better choice; it is the exact same, except it has a much better and more useful light and costs only $3 more.  Sadly, it's too late for me, since i've already bought this watch, but once I lose this one (which I'm sure I will before it ever breaks or runs out of batteries), I will definitely buy the other!<br /><br />Also, the button on the right side of the watch changes the clock from 12hr to 24hr in it's normal mode.  Sometimes, when my wrist is bent, it gets pressed unintentionally.  This isn't that much of a problem, but I don't think it needs to be that easy to change the time mode.<br /><br />One last note:  be best viewing angle for this watch is around 60 degrees.  There's a bit of unclarity if you look at it straight on at 90 degrees or if you slant it too low.  This may or may not be a problem for you, depending on your own personal habits, but I think it'd be better if there were wider viewing angles.",[],B000GAWSDG,B09TXZHKLG,AFUZNH4MSSJGUTMXVY7CEY4JZTTA,2012-03-24 21:51:42.000,0,True

1165269,5,This is a watch that can cast shadows to your wrist watch collection.,"This is a watch that can cast shadows to your wrist watch collection.<br />I bought it in Argentina. So you wont find the &#34;verified purchase&#34; sign on this review. But I guess these pieces are all of the same sort. Mine was made in Thailand. I adquired it for the gym, but I cant get if off my wrist. I like diver watches, I own a Seiko skx007, an Orient ray blue, even an Omega Seamaster. But the de F91w gets most of my wrist time and I think I know why:<br />-It is light as a feather. Being used to diver watches as I mentioned, wearing a light watch is very comfy.<br />-It is very thin. Not obstrusive at all.<br />-It is very accurate. It wins about one second every 10 days so it keeps time pretty accurately. If you have it on it goes faster, if you dont, goes a bit slower (body temperature). But you can always zero it up (back) if it is between 1 and 29 seconds o (forward) if it is between 31 and 59 seconds. So if you dont let it go further or backward more than 29 seconds you can adjust it just by pressing the right button on *adjust* mode.<br />-Its dial is very clear. Contrasty. You can see it at every angle.<br />-The watch is small *but* what I realize is that being a small watch it is not important as far as the *digits* are not small. Which is what tells you the time.<br />-Night light is dim but enough to show you the time at dark. I gess more potent light compromise the duration of the battery, so I am happy with a longer battery life and light enough to see the time at dark.<br />-Stop watch is very useful for cooking and other infinite tasks. I use it a lot to time driving times to deliver goods and put it down so I can schedule my delivery shift more accurately.<br />-It can be used as a morning wake up alarm while travelling but, if you have heavy sleep, you can put it in a mug on the bedside table (see picture) to beep more loudly directing your head. It works.<br />I think is a watch everyone should try. I was skeptical at the begining but once I bought it I discovered that the watch looks better personally than in pictures. And is very, very comfortable. I hope this review helps to whoever reads it.

1197698,5,"No Brainer Purchase - It covers all of the basics, easy to use, low cost, Casio reliability.","For the price, this is the kind of watch that a Minimalist will appreciate....it has the basics - alarm, stop watch, day/date, 24hr time option. I recently picked up a couple of Casio's, I have always owned Casio's - going back to the 80's. I have owned a few expensive pieces as well....automatic movements/ mechanical - Omegas, etc....I always break those and they require expensive servicing.....so I have come to the conclusion that Quartz watches are watches to actually use. Even within the other Casio digital quartz offerings, most people just dont need to spend more really than what this watch offers and represents. Its thin and comfortable...if you are a really big and thick boned person, it may be a problem...but it fits me just fine...and I am not a small person...anyways, I also recently picked up the Casio CA53W ($15) Calc watch and the Casio G Shock GW-M 5600 ($92 range) classic square G Shock in the Solar/ Atomic model. I like all three....but, if I had to pick just one to do all of the basic things....it may be this one - F91W that would be the choice....its something you just dont have to worry about, at under $10.....it has the basic features including a light, the CA53W doesnt have one....downside to that budget watch. The F91 has a very readable face, and an ultra easy to operate interface. As far as durability, it seems like it would hold up to the average daily use of just about anyone...again, if you are ultra hard on a watch....you can buy 2 or 3 of these and just have them on backup....or stash them in other vehicles, at work, in kits, etc. I have seen videos of guys diving at 30 feet/ 10 meters with these little watches....so you could spend $50, $100 or even much more on other Casios, let alone other brands, but what do you need at the end of the day - a watch to tell time day and night, maybe an alarm, maybe a stop watch to time things - meetings, cooking, exercise, etc.....for average practical people who dont want to break the bank and pay for features they dont need....this watch is a smart buy - it does the job. Yeah, I know watch collectors dont think this way, they want style, status, etc....but those reasons for buying a watch are beyond what the watch actually does on a daily basis. And, you have to always be thinking about an expensive watch - banging it on things, scratching the bracelet, scratching the car, not being able to reach into your pocket if its a fat watch....on and on.....just get one of these for $10 or less...and use it....then maybe it will make sense. Lastly, if you travel....you definitely dont want to travel with an expensive watch that you dont want to lose in an airport, have stolen, or generally damage during activities, not to mention, its not smart to stand out in some countries....good way to get robbed, a flashy watch. Buy 2 or 3. As far as a gift.....I think any guy would appreciate one of these as they are very retro cool....and who couldnt use a backup watch even if they already have a more pricey watch, its a watch that grows on you with its simplicity and efficiency.",[],B000GAWSDG,B09TXZHKLG,AHIN3TA6BDUMK6TMU2BQSEEWIZDA,2017-04-26 04:05:18.000,1,False

It also has the superior electro-luminescent backlight. (the A158W has a single, dim LED on the side, which brings me back to the 80s, when they had incandescent side lights)<br /><br />The A158W has a nicer display. The light gray background is smoother.

1276937,5,World's best watch?,"To address some of the negative reviews.<br /><br />1) There are a lot of fakes of this watch.  The genuine watch comes in one color, black, according to the Casio website.  Given there's a pink version available on Amazon, apparently they don't know the difference!  (See youtube on telling fakes apart.)  I bought directly from Amazon, not simply fulfilled, and received the genuine article in a Casio box, with documentation, and warranty papers.  If your watch breaks early or is inaccurate, you have a fake.  If water killed your watch, it's probably fake.  If your watch came in a plastic bag, it's probably fake.  If the watch smells like plastic, it's fake.<br /><br />2) This watch is the perfect size for smaller wrists.  If you want a big watch, this is not for you.<br /><br />3) The resin band is very comfortable.  It's waterproof, won't absorb sweat, and it nicely designed. I don't see it breaking anytime soon.<br /><br />This is a great watch.  It stays perfectly accurate for days and days.  It's been to the pool and rained on, and it still looks new.<br /><br />Note:  The correct country of origin is Thailand.

1277710,3,Good watch...poor watch band,"Don't get me wrong. Casio makes really good watches and sells them at a very low price. This watch, the F91W-1 is a great example of this....HOWEVER....they compromise drastically with the watch band. I have a very average size wrist but am forced to use the second to last hole in the band. By doing so, the keeper which you tuck the &#34;remainder&#34; of the band into is barely able to hold it. It would not cost much, if even a dollar to lengthen the bands on watches like the F91W-1. The F28-W is another one with short-band-itis. Because of the way the band is somewhat integrated into the design of the watch, changing/upgrading bands is not easy to do. Plus, removing and reinstalling the pins which secure the band to the watch is almost sure to damage the plastic tabs they mount in. Trust me, I've done it. One of Casio's best budget-priced watches, in my opinion, is the W201-1AV. Ample band length, shows day/month & date without pushing a button, PLUS a 10-year battery.

1292403,5,Great watch!!! (Just try to ignore its infamous association),"Elegant, accurate, thin watch, and excellent bang for the buck.  The optional hourly chime reminds me of my childhood.  As another reviewer noted, anyone who complains about this watch doesn't know how good a watch can be for $10.  This is one of the few digital watches that is thin enough to not snag on my long sleeve work shirts (and I button them with the looser button).  I have this great system:  I wear the A158W-1 (same watch but in shiny stainless steel; looks like it's worth $100!) for work or more professional/formal occasions, and this one for casual or sports.  For not much more than $20 for the two watches, it's an awesome system for me and I love the modesty, basic functionality, and what I call an &#34;anti-hoity toity&#34; feeling!<br /><br />Press and hold the right lower button for 5 seconds until it says &#34;Casio&#34; in digital letters to verify it's authentic.<br /><br />After I purchased it I was reading about it on a Casio collector's website and was disappointed to discover that this watch was worn by the most infamous terrorist of our time (whom I will not name; he can be seen wearing this watch in photos) and has been favored by them.  I try to ignore this awful association and just enjoy the watch.

1293371,4,Nothing Fancy - Does The Job.,"This watch is nothing fancy. It has a built-in stop watch, light and alarm (in addition to displaying the day of week - Mon, Tue, etc., time, and day - 1st, 2nd, etc.). This watch also has ""12/24 Hour"" mode so you can see the time in ""1pm"" or ""1300"" formats (i.e. ""military time"").<br /><br />I typically do not wear a wrist watch but use my cellphone instead. Due to circumstances of a camp I volunteer at, cellphones are not allowed so I needed an inexpensive replacement wrist watch that is nothing fancy (since I don't normally wear a watch and will go back to using the cellphone for time when not at this particular camp).<br /><br />This watch does the basic functions well. There are only two negatives I would give:<br /><br />1) the wrist band is a little short. For an adult reasonably muscular male (not sure what what my wrist diameter is), I was able to get the band around my wrist but ended up using the second-to-last hole in the band. Not a big deal but something to be aware of.<br /><br />2) The light is NOT a ""back-light"" in that it does NOT light up the back of the watch face. Instead, the light is mounted on the left side of the display face and shines from left to right. This causes you to need to give the display a close look when using the light feature in low / dark ambient lighting.<br /><br />As I've noted, I was looking for a BASIC / inexpensive watch and this one, even with the above two negatives, fits the bill nicely.

1307177,3,Around the House Watch,"So, I like to wear a watch around the house and when I sleep. I have a decent sized watch collection, but few things I consider to be my home utility watch. I wanted to add to that collection, so that was the mindset I had for this piece. This piece has a lot of history, which is cool, and it serves the primary function of telling time fine. However, there is some utility it lacks, and in all honesty I would tell you to pass on this watch. So hear is what I can say:<br />Intended Use: Around the house utility with need for in the dark functionality.<br />That said it fared ok at this. It is pretty small, but very clear to read. It is a very small thin watch, even on my skinny wrists, but still is able to be read in a lit room or outside easily. I do enjoy that I do not notice it, which makes it easier for doing tasks without snagging it or having it impede mobility.<br />The negative is that this light is the worst I have ever had on a watch. You get the hour and that is about it. This really killed the use for me as I like to be able to check the time quickly at night without the use of my phone.<br />Also, I use my watches for cooking, and without a countdown timer, there goes another aspect of functionality I would like. Remember it has a stopwatch, but no countdown timer.<br /><br />My recommendation would be to spend an extra ten bucks and get the really cool Casio World Time that gives you a better light, timer, stopwatch, and different time zones for travel. It is also a lot bigger and easier to read at night. I greatly prefer that watch.<br /><br />This watch however does do a killer job of telling you the time and date, and if you are looking for something with the least amount of wrist-presence while telling you the time effectively then this is a great watch. If you want much more out of it, there is a lot better for not a lot more money.",[],B000GAWSDG,B09TXZHKLG,AH7CXUBBOSVYTEWGAOSHYXS2BBVA,2019-05-02 21:34:07.647,0,True

So when operating the watch in the dark you have to memorize how to do things like set an alarm, as the light button changes settings and the light does not stay on when you press it.

1320796,4,Plain and Comfortable Design but DREADFUL LED Light,"I must say before I begin this review: I was extremely ambivalent as to whether this watch is a 3 or 4 star product.<br /><br />  As soon as I received this watch, I immediately thought it was too small, which may or may not be a good thing depending on you. I've been using my brother's G-Shock for quite a while now, and it's uncomfortable (despite all of the hype) and way too bulky! So, because of how this picture depicted the size (where the batteries go), I bought this watch. Also, the G-Shock and many other expensive watches have many designs at the sides of the back as opposed to this watch's straight round design, which makes it ergonomic. In addition, this watch is REALLY light, which again, can be good or bad. But here comes my major gripe. This watch's lighting aspect is so bad that I wouldn't even wear it if I got paid $15 to (which funnily is what happened because when I tried to refund it, Amazon politely accepted my refund AND surprised me by saying I can keep the watch too)!<br /><br />The light:<br />  First of all, the button for the light on this watch is so tiny which may make it hard to find for some people and also to push. But if you do manage to push the button, the light only stays on as long as you push it, and to completely kill the entire glory of the watch, the light is horrendous! I was so disappointed. Seriously, this light is so bad and only barely covers the left side of the watch. What was Casio thinking?!<br /><br />I would also like to add that the design of this watch is so simple and kind of boring, but once again...it's so comfortable as opposed to other bulky watches! And because of the thinness, it's much easier to slide on tight men (or women's) clothing such as dress shirts, etc. I would recommend this watch if you are willing to ignore the poorly-designed lighting portion and the ordinary look.<br /><br />*Unrelated*<br />After analyzing carefully a few other inexpensive watches, I came across Casio Men's W735H-1AVCF Super Illuminator Black Watch. This watch seems really good but also uncomfortable due to the similar strap design of the G-Shock. But what makes elevated it is the huge ""Light"" button, which I find very important and the extremely useful vibrating alarm since I am a very forgetful person, and sometimes I may be listening to something and won't hear my watch's alarm.<br /><br />Also, Casio Men's WV58A-1AVCR Waveceptor Atomic Digital Watch:<br />Has a similar designed strap (comfortable), which, as mentioned before, is what makes the Casio F91W-1 Classic Resin Strap Digital Sport Watch good! It also has EL lighting, which is far superior to LED lighting I think. Furthermore, the button for the light is medium-sized and is at the right side of the watch, which is so-so (i.e. workable).<br /><br />With a picky and frugal personality like mine, it's extremely difficult to find a perfect, inexpensive watch ($15-$25).",[],B000GAWSDG,B09TXZHKLG,AEGQEEV2NQKY2O5K4WRDUKXFU5FQ,2013-08-28 00:35:05.000,1,True

My opinion on this Casio watch is that it fits the purpose for the particular activity I've gotten it for: gym<br /><br />I wouldn't use it for day to day as i have other watches for that. The only downside I found on the watch is the built in light. When I've tried to look at the time in the morning when waking up it's a bit difficult to see what the time is. It only lights up the left side of the watch with more clarity making it hard to tell the minutes and seconds.

The back light is horrible (all the light is concentrated on the left side, have to look at the display at a pronounced angle to see anything). I wore it for a day; my much better FE10 arrived the same day; won't be wearing this one much (if ever).

1381601,4,Great Watch,"This is a great watch, it gives you everything you need, and nothing else. I mean, why would you need a watch that tells you the time, and has 36 alarms, and tells you where the moon is in the sky?<br /><br />The watch is very light-weight, and very unnoticeable. You could slap it on, and forget it was even on. The lightness comes at a small cost due to the durability of the strap, its mostly fine, but the points where it attaches to the watch, seem a little thin, or ""could be thicker"".<br /><br />The watch keeps a good time, losing maybe 20 seconds every 4 months or so? Which is fine, since its pretty simple to re-adjust the time.<br /><br />The watch is really cheap, sorta like a disposable watch, you won't worry if you lose it since its so easy to replace, and it'll last you a fourth of a life time if you treat it right.<br /><br />Though its a reliable watch, its very few bells and whistles like the light, is poorer quality, but gets the job done. Its a simple, LED or such on the left of the watch, but it gets straight to the point, it lets you see what time it is at night, or in the dark. Unless you fancy the entire thing lighting up like a flashlight then you'll be fine.<br /><br />It says its water resistance, but I wouldn't trust it.<br /><br />Overall, buy it.

1403637,5,"still love them, but mostly I just want a watch ...","I’m over big, bulky watches.  I’ve got my Suunto and a couple G-Shock watches.  I still wear them, still love them, but mostly I just want a watch that keeps nice, precise time, doesn’t stand out from my wrist 3/4 inch and hopefully looks juuuust a little dorky.  I’m also cheap.  Waterproofness is important to me.  I work a desk job.  I commute by bus or train- watches help with that.  I like to go on a run a couple times a week and wear a watch.  I don’t sleep or shower with my watch on unless I’m camping or in a hotel.  I like digital over analog because I kind of like to know exactly what time I think it is and I only ever estimate when I’m reading an analog watch because I’m lazy.  Also, when I’m in a meeting or I’ve been pinned-down by someone I don’t want to talk to and I want to know if this really is taking forever or if my perception of the passage of time is just being warped- it’s easier to sneak a peek at a digital watch and get a precise read.  I realized a few months ago that I really am just as happy wearing a $15 Casio as I am with my $250 Suunto and that most days I don’t need to know the barometric pressure.  Some days, yes.  Most days, no.  But I like having a variety of watches (including the Suunto, which is fabulous).  And I like to choose which watch to wear each morning.  That’s fun for me.  Recently I got on Amazon and ordered a bunch of new cheap Casio watches.  I got four new watches for $52.  I think Timex’s are over-priced.  That’s how cheap I am.<br /><br />Casio W-800HAV ($20-ish) Digital Black.  My eight-year old son and I each got one of these watches for Christmas 2016.  We both love it.  We both have other watches but wear this one the most.  It has a fairly low profile- doesn’t catch on pockets or shirt sleeves.  I love the light- it looks stupid, like piddly.  But it actually lights the face well.  I go jogging at night sometimes.  The light works well enough for me to see how slow I am even while I’m bouncing down the road.  And it’s got “Dual Display”.  I don’t know what else to call that.  It shows the time on one part of the screen and at the same time it show the stopwatch numbers.  Nice to keep track of both.  Or, If I’m out and about, I’ll set a stopwatch when the train goes by because I know that the train comes by every 15 minutes.  So I can see when I’m coming up on another 15-minute mark and also see the time on the sub-display.<br /><br />Casio F-201WA ($10.47)  Digital Black. Comfortable.  Lightweight.  Easiest buttons to push.  Good light.  I like that it has countdown timer and lots of alarms.  I miss being able to see the time when it’s in stopwatch mode like I can with the W-800HAV and the WV-200A.<br /><br />Casio WV-200A ($40-ish) Waceceptor Digital Black with chrome and red.  Looks good.  Like the steel case.  Good protection for the glass.  Relatively heavy.  A liiiiitle too thick.  Really nice buttons.  Great electro-luminescent light.  This one is the only watch of the group that you can set it so it doesn’t beep every time you push a button.  I really like being able to turn the beep off.  Sometimes I like to set a stopwatch in a meeting so I can see how long somebody is going on with some bullsh*t.  Strangely, timing somebody’s bullsh*t is a nice distraction from the bullsh*t.  But I don’t like my watch to beep when I’m doing pushing buttons.  “Dual display”- you can still see what time it is when you’re in other modes.  Countdown timer is nice and many of my other watches don’t have one.  I don’t give it extra points for the whole Wave Ceptor thing.  Doesn’t add any value for me and it kinda sucks battery.  This watch has been on my wrist for a full day of snorkelling and handled it beautifully.  I live in a land-locked state, so when I get to the ocean, I’m in the water ALL DAY LONG.  I can’t dive deeper than maybe 20 feet, so it’s not a serious test for a watch that says it’s good to 200m.  But if you’re diving to 200m and time is critical, you’re going to spring for something more than a $40 Casio.  (I love you, Casio).<br /><br />Casio HDA-600 ($14.79)  Black Analog.  Not the most comfortable.  Kinda squeezes my wrist from bone to bone or flops around a bit.  I dunno, it just fits weird.  YMMV.  Love the face protector.  Can’t wait until it starts to look a little banged up.  Glowy dots on the hands aren’t really impressive.  Date window works perfectly.  Looks tough but it’s probably not.  I like it a lot.<br /><br />Casio MQ24-7B2 ($14-something)  White-faced Analog. Incredibly light.  Truly forget that you’re wearing it.  Easy to read.  No date window.  No lumi.  Nice, simple and never catches your sleeve in a dress shirt. Yes, I’m fancy.  Some people are smart enough to read an analog watch that doesn’t have numbers on it- just dots.  I’m not one of those people.  I screw it up enough when there’s numbers.  This has numbers.  I like numbers.  Haven’t tested this one for waterproofyness.  Casio only says it’s water resistant.  I hardly ever do underwater demolitions anymore.<br /><br />Casio A168W-1 ($16.15) Stainless Digital. I love / hate this watch.  I don’t know if Casio was really trying to make a watch that looks fancy but it’s really a dork-bomb, or if they we’re going for dork-bomb as their aim.  Either way.  This watch is a stunning success.  I think this watch is the pinnacle of nerd-swank. 1980’s wannabe stockbroker, cool old guy who doesn’t give a sh*t, little bit of silver under the sleeve to catch someone’s eye- oh wait it’s a friggin Casio digital.  I mean, it’s chrome-plated PLASTIC for crying out loud.  How awesome is that?  I love all of that.  Love it.  It’s got the Illuminator light, which works great.  Clock, date, stopwatch and alarm.  No countdown timer. The metal band is not comfortable.  It’s got edges and it pulls on my arm fur.  Clasp works great and it’s wicked-easy to adjust.  Slips under a dress shirt easily.  Again: super-dorky.  Makes me smile every time I put it on.  Then wince when it pulls the fur.<br /><br />Casio F91W-1 ($11.35) Black Digital.  I like this watch a lot.  It’s super thin.  Very lightweight.  The light looks stupid but it works well.  The buttons are easy to hit.  It ranks pretty high on the ‘Dork’ scale.  People recognize it.  Hold that one button down and it says CASIo.  It’s great.  Proud to say I’ve never worn this watch along with flannel and a beanie.  Never.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71OXn5oPrJL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71OXn5oPrJL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71OXn5oPrJL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B000GAWSDG,B09TXZHKLG,AHQTXCKARFJUVOLUCPBBIDALN4OQ,2016-10-04 22:31:37.000,708,True

1404967,5,A trustworthy friend.,"This watch is a classic. It won't ever go out of style for one reason, it does what it's supposed to and it does it well. Nothing more, nothing less.<br /><br />Easy - It's digital so you look down and you know what time it is. Seems silly but being able to quickly read the time is nice.  Programming it is a cinch. There are only three buttons so even if the buttons weren't labeled (which they are) it's not hard to figure out. There are only basic functions like alarm, time, date, and stopwatch. That's it. You don't have to go through a million different options and weird combinations of button presses.<br /><br />Durable - I wore it on a camping trip to Zion and Bryce Canyon. It survived rocks, dust, water, mud, sun, and my recklessness. There's hardly a scratch on it and the watch face is still immaculate.<br /><br />Comfortable - It's very light and compact. I can wear it all day and not notice it. My wrists are on the smaller side so the size of the watch face suits me well. It's not overbearing like a lot of other watches for men. By the way, this is fine as a unisex watch. Much respect to all people who wear this watch, men or women. You get extra points in my book.<br /><br />Reliable - The battery will last. Time-telling is pretty accurate. Oddly durable. Simple. You won't mind wearing it. Also, really cheap. There's a reason these watches haven't changed. You'll have the peace of mind of knowing you can lose it and abuse it, and easily and inexpensively replace it. No need to baby it or worry about it.<br /><br />It seems odd to buy a watch when everyone uses cellphones for everything but once you start wearing a watch you really are more observant of time. It truly does keep you cognizant. This item belongs in the category of things like Nokia phones, Koss Porta-pros, IBM mechanical keyboards, and old Swingline staplers. They just simply work. Form and function going hand in hand. So you could spend money on a restaurant burger, a bottle of wine, a movie ticket, a drink at a bar or... you could buy this watch which will last you the next 20 years. You could also keep browsing trying to find the perfect watch but think of all the time you might be wasting.<br /><br />If you want to scream the word ""practical"" then this timeless timepiece is for you.",[],B000GAWSDG,B09TXZHKLG,AH5FFFCUBBMOFW2MXPZXAFLUCXQA,2012-05-30 18:00:02.000,1,True

Cooking, showering, swimming, beach, surfing, etc. This watch can handle it, but diving is a no go.<br /><br />It's easy to set an alarm, use the stop-watch, set the time, etc. It's a simple watch, it's straightforward.

The watch has a light but the light only comes from the leftside of the screen, it's bright enough to illuminate the entire watch face but you can clearly tell the light only comes from the left, because part of the right side of the watchface is still somewhat dim even while the backlight is on.<br />- It'd be nice to have a dedicated light button. Sometimes I need to ajdust the time, or check the stopwatch, or shut off an alarm in the dark, but it's not possible here, because the light button is the selection button, it changes your current setting selection, so if you want to add an hour to adjust for daylights savings, you can't do it in the dark, because everytime you get your watch to the hours setting, if you push the light button, it will change to the date-settings, so you'll suddenly be forced to adjust the date. I know the slightly more expensive version of this watch has 4 buttons which gets rid of this problem, so if this is going to be ahuge problem for you, spring for 4 buttons intead of 3.

1450194,5,If you're looking for a wristwatch daily driver...,"At one point in time, I tried to be one of the few smartwatch believers. I thought that the future lied with wearable technology, and that smartwatches were signs of the future in the present. I wore a Pebble with pride and loved it dearly, then I made the jump to a gorgeous, Android Wear Moto 360. I adored the thing for about three months, before growing tired of the clunky software, hard to use interface, and the user experience that just made it easier to pull out my phone and complete what I wanted. For a category of product based around getting you to interact with your wrist as a quicker, easier alternative to pulling out your phone, it seemed all I did was just that - and I got sick of it.<br />So, after not wearing it for a month, I ordered this Casio watch and took my Moto 360 to the pawnshop for fifteen dollars. When this came in and I put it on for the first time, I was struck with the revelation that there was no other way - there was no need for anything more complex on my wrist and in my life than this classic piece of tech.<br />I wear it day in and day out, except for showering. It is resilient, water resistant enough to handle natural, day to day splashes and accidents, easy to use and it always works. I can always count on the back light in a dark room, I can always count on it to beep with every hour, if I desire an alarm or stopwatch I can find it with only a few clicks of it's simple UI - it is simply reliable. It also looks good enough with nearly every outfit I've worn, being both casual enough and being small and discreet enough to look fine with dressier outfits.<br />I love this thing. I've tried mechanical watches, and I've tried the smartwatches, and sure - they all have their purposes. But if you're looking for your daily driver of wrist wear, look no further: this little thing will fulfill all your time telling needs... and just enough more.",[],B000GAWSDG,B09TXZHKLG,AH5XKMY5YXQYVGXV6P6HHYPMW3QA,2017-09-16 01:57:20.595,0,False

1456118,4,Great watch!,"I love this watch. What I love most about this watch is the compact light-weight feel of it. It is simple to use and has decent functions. I use this watch for everyday use, including hiking/camping.<br /><br />When I use it for everyday life here in Southern California, it does exactly what I want it to do; tell me time. Not much more you can ask for.<br /><br />When I take it hiking/camping, I notice some problems. First is that the light button sucks. It is located poorly on the top left corner and the light it gives off is pretty crappy. I can read the time, but it could display the time better. Also the light only stays on while pushing on the button; I'd prefer the watch to light up for a few sec after pushing the button once. The second problem is that there is condensation within the screen in hot or cold weather. Idk what it is exactly, but a somewhat thick layer of water solidifies under the screen in certain temperatures and conditions. Reading the time because very difficult when this occurs. The screen eventually clears up and looks good again when conditions get better, but it shouldn't happen at all. I wonder about the water-resistance capabilities of this watch. I'm afraid to even shower with it on. It gets an A for scratch-resistance however. I've brushed against trees, bushes, etc and the screen still looks great.<br /><br />Overall it's a great introductory watch for a low price of 11$. It has been very useful to me and I'm glad I bought it. If this watch was 15$+ though, I don't think I would buy it again; for 10$ I would.

I wish that the entire date was displayed.<br />If you are looking for an inexpensive go to digital watch it is almost impossible to go wrong with this one.

It is not one of those fancy digital watch that will tell the altimeter or distance above sea level. It keep track of time, and tell the date, that's it, the essential thing a watch design to do. The digital display can be change between 12 and 24 hour display. It also display the day of the week and seconds. To calibrate it, simply press one of the button until the screen flash. The battery is extremely durable, it will last more than 10 year.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />The screen of the watch can be scratch easily. If you are a outdoor person, this watch will get scratch some how. I have used this watch for two years, then the strap start to crack, eventually it breaks. The plastic wrist strap is not design to last long, it will not stand strong heat, so do not leave this watch in the car during summer season. Unfortunately, the strap cost almost as much as the watch. So it will be easier to buy a new one, instead of replacing the strap.<br /><br />Final Thoughts:<br /><br />The batter will long a really really long time, but It doesn't matter how long the battery will last, the wrist strap will fail first.

1586536,4,Great Affordable Watch - Not a waste of $11.49,"(SKIP TO END FOR QUICK VERDICT WITH LESS DETAIL)<br />DETAILED ANALYSIS: This watch is great if you need a simple yet solid digital watch to keep track of overall  time. If you have an active lifestyle and are looking for an affordable watch to pick up, then I would highly recommend it. I am personally satisfied with the ergonomics, and the general build seems sturdy and well constructed. The water resistance also seems to be satisfactory. If I had to point out any doubts in the build of this watch, the only questionable part is the band. The feel of the band does not feel like that of a band made from premium material. So far, the watch is still fully intact and functioning and the band seems like it can sustain under fairly tough circumstances, however, I believe the best way to upgrade this watch would be to interchange the band. Another aspect that needs room for improvement is the backlight. The back light barely lights up half of the watch interface (see photos for example), and it's actually very disappointing. If you are going to depend highly on this watch in the dark, I probably wouldn't recommend it.

1611485,4,"A Good Sports Watch, but the nightlight is inadequate and there is no timer.","I bought this watch to replace a 32 year old Casio.  After doing my research, I bought the Ironman Classic 30 and a Casio F91W.<br />The Ironman is a better watch, but The price and ruggedness of the Casio can’t be beat.<br /><br />First, I need to put this review in context.  I am a reasonably, if not very active, forty-something.  I am fit, but I have a 40 year old’s eyes and sensibilities.  I use this watch primarily Just to tell time at the gym, hiking, biking or maybe swimming.  I have some secondary use for it as a timer or stopwatch, but that is about it.<br /><br />As you might have guessed, I am a bit of a watch minimalist, so I was happy with the size of the watch.  However, I am realizing that a 35mm watch may not be optimal for a 40 year old’s eyes.  To be clear I think the watch is perfectly legible/ readable, but the larger face of the Ironman is easier to read and better for older eyes.<br /><br />Personally I find the controls for the watch intuitive and easier to use (other than the smaller buttons) than the Ironman, but that is coming from a guy who used a similar watch for 32 years.  I have two complaints that kept me from giving five stars.  First, the light on the watch isn’t bright enough to be much use— but again this is literally the view of a middle aged man.  Younger or more near-sighted eyes may find the light perfectly adequate.  Secondly,  I actually would have appreciated a timer function and this watch doesn’t have one.<br /><br />Overall, i give this four stars.  Ease of use, price and ruggednesses are this watches best attributes; an inadequate light and a lack of a timer are its biggest weaknesses.  So if you have $25 more to spend and don’t mind (or like) a more chunky watch, I’d recommend the Ironman Classic 30 over this watch.  However, if you want to save a few bucks and your eyes are sharper than mine, the Casio is a fine choice.",[],B000GAWSDG,B09TXZHKLG,AGNQ4LZ7IDK54GIKCMDUKP5TZ35Q,2019-08-06 08:57:23.655,2,True

The alarm is too quiet to hear if there is any significant ambient noise.  The biggest problem, however, is the length of the band.  While I am not small, I feel that I have a normal sized wrist and this watch is tight even on the last hole.  In addition, because the band is so short, on the last hole or two the tail of the band does not remain in the retainer and sticks out, hanging up on the sleeve of my shirt.  The band needs to be an inch or so longer.

I have showered a few times with it on and it seems fine but I haven't tried swimming with it yet.

The one I got was too short for my wrist, and I am not a large male.  The buckle is plastic with a plastic pin instead of metal.  This means that if the tiny short end of the plastic pin falls off, you have likely lost your watch.  The end of the pin is only about one eighth of an inch in length and one sixteenth of an inch thick.  I have seen these tips break off and that is all that is holding the watch to your wrist.  It is planned obsolescence.  The resin band on a fairly new one I purchased half broke within about a year.  That is another quick way to lose your watch.  Maybe a thicker band would help.

Being able to keep track of time makes him feel less anxious and helps him to stay on schedule. I chose this because it’s small, simple and affordable (plus these Casio watches are a classic). Nothing flashy, kid-friendly, and does what it’s intended for. Bonus points for date and day.

It is small, which is perfect for my small wrists, and displays the time and the date, which is hard to find in a good, SMALL digital watch.<br />I’ve worn it 24/7 since the day I got it and it is holding up really well. I’m a preschool teacher so this watch has already lived through a bunch of crafts involving paint, glue, glitter, and all kinds of other messy things and it still looks brand new. It is very easy to clean and easy to set.<br />I think it may be a junior size because usually I wear watches on the tightest setting and still have some wiggle room but I wear this one 2 places from the tightest setting and it’s a perfect, snug fit. It’s great for me but may be too small for a larger wrist.<br />ALSO, this watch is low profile so it doesn’t get caught on things and doesn’t get in the way at all.<br />All in all, I would highly recommend this watch.

It's got better accuracy than mechanical watches that cost thousands. It's reliably waterproof unless you are a scuba diver. I never have the battery replaced when it runs down, because in my experience, cheap watches that undergo battery replacement often are no longer waterproof (I've done a lot of swimming, free diving and sailing, also tropical rain-forest/jungle photography). When the battery goes, I just throw it away and buy another one. If you don't use the the watch's features much, the battery can last as long as seven years.

1723996,4,"In production 25 years, though the strap is a weak point","I have a few of these one bought back in 1991 when the F-91W had just come out. The design is pure Casio and distinctive, though the features at the time were fairly good (alarm, 1/100th sec chronograph, 12/24 hour and date format - no year though) it's not the main reason for looking at one. More of a blast to the past and a nod to the design.<br /><br />Water resistant to 30 metres (and they are WR unlike some), green LED back light it's a basic watch and with a good battery life... I get around 5/6 years on the watches I have used and worn. It's a bog standard but appealing Casio, so popular in fact far eastern makers have copied the design minus the obvious Casio logo.<br /><br />Now the weakest part by far isn't the case which is pretty tough as is the transparent cover over the display; The resin strap is prone to failure if you tend to wear a watch all the time (by that I mean all day long even at night) you will likely encounter the strap failure issue; it's also a bit smaller than most watches making it unsuitable for those with larger wrists (quite a good fit for kids and most adults but if you have larger wrists beware - it's 22.3cm or just over 8.6 inches long from tip to tip). You can replace it or not worry about if it you only occasionally wear the watch. There are higher end models around with larger displays and more snazzy features, this just has an appeal that continues to grow even to this day.",[],B000GAWSDG,B09TXZHKLG,AGBCI5O6456OYCLGGREMEWQS67BQ,2016-06-01 20:35:55.000,0,False

The upper left button turns on the backlight, cancels the alarm, and is used for selecting settings.  Holding the backlight button for 5 seconds activates a high intensity stream of energy that can be used to ignite things; intended for cigars. The lower left button cycles the modes of the watch: time display, alarm, stopwatch, and time adjustment. The button on the right is the function button: when used it starts and stops the stopwatch, changes the settings currently being adjusted, or switches between the 12- and 24-hour modes, depending on what mode the watch is currently in.<br /><br />The time or date is adjusted by pressing the lower left button three times to bring the watch to time adjustment mode.

1745019,4,"A solid water-resistant watch, but uncomfortable wrist and unreliable date","This watch is very water resistant and practical. I've taken it in the shower, a spring, and a pool and had no problems. Two things I don't like is how it feels and how easily the date switches on its own. The wrist part is made of of a material that kind of sticks to you like your skin does to certain fabrics on a hot summer day. It's really irritating to me, but I'm sensitive to that. My solution has been to wear it as loose as possible. A more annoying problem is that that the day of the week and date keep changing themselves. I think the button gets pressed as I am moving about. This is bad if you think it's one day and its actually not. I usually catch it and correct it, but that facilitates the need for a phone which contradicts the whole reason why I bought the watch, to not use my phone. I think you get what you pay for and it's fine if you need a watch for the most basic purpose of time. I have not found a need for the other functions, but they seem easy enough to work after you read the instruction manual. I have had the watch for about a month and it's already a bit scratched up.

I have seen videos of people running over this watch with a car and if still being fine, so it should last. The first thing that gives out on these watches is usually the band, which from what I hear lasts about 2-3 years, after which point you can either buy a new band and replace it, or just pay a tiny bit extra and get a whole new watch.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71sh5Kqo5nL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71sh5Kqo5nL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71sh5Kqo5nL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B086RQHJQM,B09TXZHKLG,AFHEUSEQ6ZLYR7CKUW4SYKNKC3CQ,2021-07-20 09:04:14.560,11,True

1787431,5,Cheap and simple. To check the time.,"This is the best watch for my size wrist, Being small. it's simple. Shows the time, day, and if it's Monday or Thursday. I bought it mainly because I found myself looking at the time on my phone. And I don't like taking out my phone when I am out and about unless I really need to. Alone, I like to have all my attention on my surroundings. So a quick flip of the wrist and I check the time, then I go back to what I am doing. It's safer and faster. Where I am from and I know most places now, a lot of people so distracted with phones that they forget someone can easily swipe your phone off your hands or knock you down for you not paying attention. The light is ok. It would be cool if they made this same design but with the screen black and the numbers red or what ever color your choose. Heart beats per minute added into this would be cool as well. But then that would make it more expensive, and nobody wants that lol.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61MvKO6OmtL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61MvKO6OmtL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61MvKO6OmtL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B000GAWSDG,B09TXZHKLG,AEPJ7VABBZVVMAEBKNYW6IC5H4FQ,2022-12-08 23:13:50.960,11,True

1787732,5,"Great, Cheap Watch","I've only had this watch for maybe a month or two, but most of the the existing positive reviews seem to be spot on. I have higher-end automatic watches for work and dress but for the weekend, this is perfect. I don't have to worry about  hitting it on things or scratching it because although it seems to be well constructed and I fully expect it will last a long time, at this price point, it's almost disposable.<br /><br />Most anything that can be said about this watch at this point has been said since it's been around for a while, but a few brief thoughts.<br /><br />It has alarm functionality that works and even though I usually use my cell phone as my alarm, it's nice to have the option if for whatever reason I am without my phone (e.g. camping). Also has a stopwatch. It is water resistant, although I'm not sure I'd go swimming with it. The water resistance ratings on watches tend to be overly optimistic and based on lab conditions - so for example, I'd consider something that indicates 50M water resistance (like this watch) to be suitable for a shower and maybe some light swimming - but a dive watch, this is not.<br /><br />Other features are day and date which are nice as well (I find it somewhat funny you'd probably pay $10K+ for an automatic watch with that functionality).<br /><br />The illumination is not cast evenly across the face, but it does illuminate enough to see the numbers clearly, which is really all you need.<br /><br />Only negative is probably on the fashion front, but that's not enough to deduct a star since it's such a subjective factor. I think it does have a kind of retro-cool look to it, but my wife detests the watch. Her main issue, and one that I can understand, is that the face is so small, it looks almost comical on my wrist, and I don't have huge wrists. But again, not worth deducting a star.",[],B000GAWSDG,B09TXZHKLG,AGOXOBYESHBFD7OP6Z6CYQBUHW5A,2014-01-05 00:19:27.000,0,True

The Timex developed problems and I threw it away and replaced it with this classic watch. It will be the second time in my life that I have owned this model of watch. The weakness is the band. The first one ended up being a pocket watch after the band ripped. It doesn't sit quite right on my wrist but it is so light that it doesn't bother me. It is an amazingly modest and honest watch. I was happy to see all of the positive reviews of this watch. There is something wonderful indeed about it and it will be a sad day when production ceases.,[],B000GAWSDG,B09TXZHKLG,AFZ3MPMPFILXB6QAOAMR77NQR7EA,2017-10-07 15:27:35.601,0,True

The display is readable in any condition and the watch / included band are very comfortable and light on the wrist. I first tried out the more expensive Casio “world traveler” watch, and it wasn’t comfortable whatsoever. This tiny Casio F91w feels like a much smarter option. It’s disposable by choice, the watch won’t force you to throw it out for a replacement but if you can if you want. So far, I haven’t noticed much time loss, but with how easy it is to set the watch, if it started falling out of sync updating it would be no problem.

1908074,5,Awesome watch Great on a NATO or Zulu strap,"First off I had to put it on a Zulu strap because the stock resin band is was way to short. It was not even long enough to completely go around my 8 3/4 inch wrist, I bought this already knowing this point So fyi  the review will reflect it on a NATO or Zulu strap not on the stock resin band<br />Pros.<br />1.Very light weight on a NATO or Zulu strap. You barley know know its there through out the day. It don't feel like a boat anchor on your wrist.<br />2.The alarm and hourly chime is loud it is about 2 times loud as my G-Shock GWM5610<br />3.Price,if you are on a budget and need a reliable time piece I recommend this and a after market NATO strap .<br />4. It gives me nostalgic feelings back to the late 80's when my dad wore a f91 .<br />5.Seven year average battery life is great.<br />6.The case back is stainless steel with 4 screws  and a gasket ,not a snap back case you would expect at this price point<br />7.Quartz accuracy. I don't need to say more.<br />8.The digits are easy to read.<br />Cons<br />1.The light only lights up from the left side and is only good in complete darkness.<br />2..Taking That strap off and putting on a NATO strap was a pain, I ended up using regulars spring bars and spring bar tool ,Recommend searching ""Casio F91W NATO strap"" on the internet if you plan on putting one on, or are thinking about it.<br />3.The watch crystal is acrylic resin ,and will  Scratch.<br />4.The size is small to todays standards of bigger watches if that bothers you this is not the watch for you and look at the bigger digital watches Casio offers.<br />5.Some might say the it feels cheap  with the case made of resin.<br />6.If you have a big wrist you have to go with a after market strap.<br /><br />In conclusion this is my new go to field / beater watch  and cant beat value for what you get .","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81V1xm3-5dL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81V1xm3-5dL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81V1xm3-5dL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81tgyzP6oVL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81tgyzP6oVL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81tgyzP6oVL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B000GAWSDG,B09TXZHKLG,AH5KVEJSVZISG4KBWQM6D336S3YA,2020-12-05 02:07:40.102,0,True

1951036,5,Great affordable versatile watch.,"Cult classic and justly so. If you've never tried one, you will likely be pleasantly surprised. Of course it looks exactly like what it is, a cheap watch; but a good one. Try not to bend the strap back over the buckle like you would with a leather strap and it will last a lot longer. I have and enjoy other more expensive watches from Citizen, Seiko, Rotary; this Casio gets a lot of wear time. When the strap eventually does break, a NATO type seems to be the popular choice for a replacement. Very long-wearing. Read some reviews for this watch. I learned a thing or two.<br /><br />Cons: Sometimes the buttons can be inadvertently pushed. Visibility in some lighting conditions may be lacking. If you really snag the strap it can break or tear. If the little keeper breaks the strap may soon break too, right at the buckle. The light is a bit weak.<br /><br />Pros: Light as a feather. Adjustable to a wide range of wrist sizes, so a fun choice for a child's watch. Many colours to pick from. Digital display, if you've never had one, is instant and positive. For some people, reading an analog face can be confusing, especially when one is used to am / pm, and confronted with 24 hour times; when you are traveling and are tired, for example. So the ability to swap the display between am / pm or 24 hours is a plus. The alarm is useful. Materials are more unaffected by sweat, saltwater, and grime than a leather strap. So, useful as a work watch, or for many outdoors activities. Very inexpensive, almost disposable. Widely available, so easily replaced. Long battery life. Operation of buttons and features is easy.<br /><br />Very highly recommended!",[],B000GAWSDG,B09TXZHKLG,AGKUB6SIW5TWCT2Z7Q5P3EHKNTWQ,2016-12-07 00:27:30.000,1,True

You get an alarm function that's super loud, I can hear it a few rooms over. The light works great during low light/night time. And as for the water resistance, it's splash resistant for sure I've spilled water on it and it works fine. Not a swim/dive watch though, but for $10 like I said you are getting some pretty good water resistance that will do great in rain, washing hands. Anything like that. It's also pretty good looks wise, kind of small but I like watches like this. Crystal has yet to scratch even though I've banged it up. Band feels nice too and you can swap it out of course.

1984330,5,Best Watch I've Ever Had,"I bought this product when I got a job that required me to pretty heavily keep track of the time. The water resistance and the stopwatch really sold me on the product, so I went ahead and placed my order.<br /><br />After using this product for a week I loved it. This is, by far, the best watch I have ever had. It is easy to use, quick to read from, and always accurate. I will, however, issue a warning on the product.....<br /><br />After I used my casio for a year one of the buttons on the side jammed and I was no longer able to switch screens from the clock to the alarm to the stopwatch. HOWEVER, it needs to said that I wear my watch everyday, all day long AND I use that button multiple times a day to time various tasks I am assigned to do. If you do not need to time things or use the alarm very often, I highly doubt you will have this problem.<br /><br />With that being said, this product was so wonderful and easy to use that, despite that, I still ordered a brand new one when my original casio jammed. And that is the ONLY problem I have ever had with the watch. I have absolutely no other complaints.<br /><br />In short: I highly recommend buying this product, even if you, like myself, use it so much that it breaks within the year.

1985185,5,"Good, Basic, and Cheap Watch","I purchased this for a little more than 8 bucks after seeing it mentioned in a ""dealzmodo"" post on gizmodo. For what it is, it's a nice little watch.<br /><br />It's very small and light. You will forget you're even wearing it as soon as you put it on your wrist. It has a very thin profile so it won't catch on your pocket or other things when reaching into tight spaces. The band is a little on the shorter size. I have about a 7"" wrist circumference and this is about the largest the watch will accommodate comfortably. I usually wear it on the 3rd or 4th hole from the end. It's pretty tight for me when wearing it on the 4th. It feels better on the 3rd but then the little band that slides over the the excess strap after it's buckled doesn't have much to hold on to and slides off very easily. If you wear it on the 1st or second hole, you won't even be able to utilize the little band the the end of the watch strap will always stick out from your wrist. The band quality is also not the greatest. I'm sure it would break within a couple years if you wear it regularly. However, you can't really expect more for the price.<br /><br />The mineral display is very clear and easy to read. Since the bezel is flush with the screen, it would probably be pretty easy to scratch if you rubbed it up against a wall or something. There is a small green LED light on the left side of the display that can be activated to view the time in the dark. It could be better, but it lights up the screen just enough to be able to view all the characters in the dark.<br /><br />It's rather light on features but has all the main ones you would need in a basic digital watch. Time (12 and 24 hour), date,  stopwatch, and alarm (with hourly chime option). It keeps great time too.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great watch for the money. I bought it to wear in situations where I don't want to risk harm to my G-Shock MTG-900. You don't have to be careful with this one. It can be abused and if it breaks or is lost, you're only out about $10 and it can easily be replaced. 5 stars easily.",[],B000GAWSDG,B09TXZHKLG,AEFPNCVKODWZUNO3DNWFJGVVQ2NQ,2013-01-22 19:56:15.000,0,True

2012073,5,The Glock of digital watches,"First: What Amazon calls ""white"" is actually the silver model. Do not order a ""white"" one expecting a white case.<br /><br />To the review:<br /><br />This watch is good. My usual hesitation with digital watches is that they are extremely overcomplicated, with alarms I do not know how to shut off (or set), etc. G shocks, Suuntos, etc, are all good watches if you need all their features. However, I do not. I expect most people do not. Most people need the time and date, and the Casio does this, and it does this well.<br /><br />I also like 24 hour time, and this is only possible on digital watches, unless you track down a Soviet submariner watch, which I don't want to do.<br /><br />This is the Glock of digital watches. Like a Glock shoots every time, and nothing else, the F-91W tells the time, date, and not much else. It has an alarm and a stopwatch if you are into that. They are unobtrusive features if you do not go in for them. The buttons do not get accidentally pressed, the housing is very low profile.<br /><br />I have only had this for a couple of days, so we will see on durability, but anecdotally these can take a lot of abuse.<br /><br />This would also be a good first watch for kids or for a elderly person who just wants a thing that can tell time.<br /><br />The LED light is a touch dim. According to how good your vision is, you might not be able to see the minutes and seconds, but you will probably be able to see the hour.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71xFbW7ONzL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71xFbW7ONzL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71xFbW7ONzL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B01N7XKNSX,B09TXZHKLG,AHPNONA442BWTKOH2YIQ2LSY2NYA,2022-07-22 19:13:38.711,17,True

2053526,5,The BEST WATCH under $15.  Terrorist or not.,"Well.  I contemplated for some time if I should write a review for this ultra affordable watch or not ... after some thoughts, this Casio deserves every bit of my highest recommendations so I decided to go for it<br /><br />If you are reading this ... either you stumbled on the F91W-1 by looking at some of the cheapest Amazon stocked watches<br />Or you read from Wikipedia, or some watch forums, or other sources that this Casio is the favorite among the terrorist group.<br /><br />Well regardless what your motivation is ... this watch is worth every penny.<br /><br />Some background information.  I been collecting mechanical watches for about 16+ years.  And right now I own over 50 watches... From this humble $11 Casio to a few Rolex, Zenith, Omega, JLC that cost 500 times its price.  I also service some of my own mechanical pieces.  Although I do not have much experience with quartz watches.  I do know quite a bit about material, design and many aspects of a proper horological machine.<br /><br />And the down right truth is, there is nothing this Casio can't do.  As far as a practical machine, it can beat up your datejust/ submariner any day of the week.  (Although this might not be that big of a deal in todays cell phone oriented world)<br /><br />Pros:<br />It is designed to be simple and intuitive, the trait of most Casios.  Button placement and functions are down right instinctive once you use it for a day or two.<br /><br />It is deadly accurate (duh), its quartz.<br /><br />The battery life is an amazing 7 years (given you use certain functions only once or twice a day.) Although some ""upgraded"" version has 10 year or solar battery.  The battery life is more then reasonable for any practical purpose.<br /><br />This is the most comfortable watch I own, due to one reason - the weight.  It feels like you are wearing a feather or nothing at all. 20 grams to be exact... or 0.7oz.  Crazy how light this thing is.<br /><br />The retro styling is another plus .. it may not have been cool in the 80~90s.  The nerdy black resin square case is now hip again...<br /><br />The construction of this watch is very well thought out to simplify the manufacturing process.  Which, btw, is done in Thailand.  Case is a single piece resin with slightly protruding plastic crystal.  All the electronics are on a one piece of ic board.  The case back is made from stamped stainless steel, secured by 4 screws, and the interior is where the alarm speaker goes.  A rather large rubber gasket surrounds the movement.  Light weight rubber strap with some mysterious reflective inclusion.<br /><br />Cons<br />Water resistance:  The case construction does not allow any serious form of water resistance... as a matter of fact, in the Casio manual they do not recommend anything more then hand washing.  The real problem is the pushers, they lack any gasket so water will pour in when use underwater.  The tolerance of the case and SS back is decent.  But the gasket sits too low so a 100% secure seal will not be possible.  Crystal seems to be glued into place, so no problem with water there.  I think degrees of water resistance is how Casio separates their cheapest products from the slightly more expensive one.<br /><br />You can hear something rattle when you shake this watch ... it is nothing major however<br /><br />If you are used to today's super large watch... namely, Graham, Panerai, 44mm, 50mm or the likes.  This watch will look puny to you at 35mm.  But if you like most watches in the 70s or 80s ... this is just the right size.<br /><br />The bottom line is ... this is a hell of a watch for the money.  As utilitarian as it could be yet possess some of the funk from the past decades.  It also carries a good amount of interesting back stories if you tell people about its popularity among the terrorists.  A great watch!

I paid around $15 shipped am very happy with it.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/7103cK0QitL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/7103cK0QitL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/7103cK0QitL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71LaIAM-fqL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71LaIAM-fqL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71LaIAM-fqL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71X5DeBSwuL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71X5DeBSwuL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71X5DeBSwuL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07C9F8XLL,B09TXZHKLG,AHW7WRLN3GZA4K2C6M2JVNMUUXKA,2020-07-31 02:55:08.447,11,True

2122824,5,"The ur-digital watch. It's perfectly imperfect, is both more and less than you think.","The F91W (named with letters and numbers in true Casio fashion) is a modern classic. It is the ur-digital watch. Is it perfect? No, but also yes. It is very affordable compared to almost all other watches, yet made with a respect for quality that far exceeds the no-name watches on drugstore racks. Like all classics, it is both more and less than its reputation.<br /><br />How is it less? Well, it would be nice to have a dedicated light button so that you didn't have to activate the light every time you wanted to change the alarm time or reset the stopwatch--yes, the light goes on whenever you press that top-left button in any mode. I can't complain about the light itself, which is a yellow-green and charmingly weak LED, because the F105W model exists for those who want a bright, uniform backlight, and it costs about the same amount as this watch with just a slightly different appearance. It would be nice if the strap were attached with spring bars instead of push-through pins. But these may be necessary measures to keep the cost low, and they speak to the watch's approach of functional economy and simplicity above all else.<br /><br />How is the F91W more than its reputation? There's a grace in a product that does one or a few things as well as you need it to and doesn't strive to impress with unnecessary bells and whistles. That is the nature of the F91W. It tries only to be what you need it to be and succeeds beautifully. Its design, form, and function are in harmony, and that is a rare and lovely quality for a consumer product. Am I a hipster for wearing this watch? Perhaps, but its reputation as the everyman's timepiece is so strong that it can't be pigeonholed into an emblem for a single group of people.<br /><br />The F91W is not a large watch. I have a moderately sized 6.75&#34; wrist, and I would argue that it is well-proportioned for my wrist, though much smaller than most watches that I wear. If you are willing to broaden your perception of how big a watch should be to include a size that would have been at home on your grandfather's wrist, you will like this watch. Sometimes I want a larger watch, but often I really appreciate that this one is so slim and light that it doesn't get in my way, doesn't hang up on my cuffs, and doesn't press into the back of my hand when I bend my wrist back. I would probably buy this again if it were lost or broken, and at the price I paid of $10.20 + tax in January 2015, it would be affordable to do so.",[],B000GAWSDG,B09TXZHKLG,AEE2B76FE6LVAWDKM44UEEF3LDLQ,2016-01-20 15:37:57.000,5,True

2175167,4,"Kind of cool, but not worth the money (25$)","Anyone who has owned an F-91w knows it a a great watch so I will only talk about the differences compared to a standard F-91w. First the watch band. It is slightly darker than it appears in the amazon picture (see my picture) but overall looks good. It does however feel significantly different to the standard F-91w. It is much less flexible and as a result, it's less comfortable. It is also glossy which causes some annoying squeaks against the buckle and case. It might go away over time as the band wears down, but it thought I should mention it. My biggest complaint however is with the case. Instead of making it transparent grey like the band, they just painted it gray. It looks ok in some lights and really bad in others. I know it would cost more to make the case translucent, but it would have made it look way better. It's not a bad watch which is why I'm still giving it 4 stars, but especially for $25 I was expecting a bit more.

Second, the strap is called “Men’s Standard.” I’m a really tall guy with large wrists, so standard watch sizes usually run small for me. This thing was pretty tight for a “standard” strap size.

2189854,5,"This is my Casio. There are many like it, but this one is mine.","My first watch was a little blue and green affair that looked like a lily, and when you pressed a button, the lily flipped up and a little frog sprang out on a spring. Then aged 11, I got a Casio F91W and have never looked back. The strap breaks for me, on average, every three years (I wear it tight and the plastic strap gets bent 180 degrees regularly), but besides that I've never had a problem.<br /><br />I thought briefly this year about getting a smart watch, but the fact is, you simply don't need a watch to do anything else than the Casio does. It tells you the time, lets you time things, and sets alarm to remind you of the time. It has one brief, and it sticks to it. And it does it forever, without complaints, without worries about it being stolen, and without ever running out of battery. I keep all my old watches, so my room is like a graveyard of Casio F91Ws, and not *one* of them has run out of battery - the only reason I'm having to get another one is because it's so cheap, it's easier to buy one than have it repaired. More money for Casio, I figure.<br /><br />If you want to carry around a piece of expensive digital technology with the time on it that will regularly fail on you because you haven't charged it in 12 hours, get an iPhone. If you want a watch that tells you the time, there's an entire community of Casio buddies all over the world waiting to notice your watch and ""Hey, you've got the Casio too! Aren't they cool?!"" - and then say nothing else because the Casio is so Spartan, so obvious, so reliable in its simplicity the only real question you ask is ""Do you have the backlight?""<br /><br />Long live the Casio F91W!",[],B000GAWSDG,B09TXZHKLG,AGJM2ZWFSKAYDOGMOY667K77E4YQ,2013-07-16 07:06:09.000,0,False

Is a label that serves as a warning that the product one just purchased was made using cancer causing elements.<br />Obviously I don’t have the intention of eating my watch anytime soon however like all plastic products this will soon turn to micro-plastics and we will all be consuming it.<br />Americans on average are eating about 5 grams (like a credit card) worth of micro plastics a week. It’s like a little sprinkle of cancer with every meal/sip and it’s completely unnecessary. Especially in a country that shuts down the world economy for two years over a common cold with a 99.997% survival rate.

2237890,3,"Affordable, but would spend more to get a better watch","I bought this to replace my AE1200WH after it broke at the lug. Before that one I had an AE1000W, which is the same as the 1200WH (it just looks different). I bought this because I wanted to try a slightly cheaper watch. However, I'd go back to the AE1200WH in a heartbeat. If you have a couple extra bucks, buy an AE watch.<br />I wish I had known that F91-W's had push pins instead of spring pins. I intended on changing the strap for a NATO strap when I unboxed it, but it took a lot of effort to take them out without scratching the plastic. I could've just gotten an AE Casio. They have wide spring-loaded pins, which will make changing straps easier, and give you more strap options.<br />This watch beeps whenever you press buttons, and you can't turn it off (you can in both AE models). The built-in light doesn't really do much, while the AE models light up the whole display. AE models tell you the month. AE models also have world time, a longer stopwatch, and a timer countdown function. You can swim and take a shower with an AE and still keep your warranty. Plus, the AE1200WH looks a lot nicer than the F91-W, and I've gotten a bit of attention when I wear the AE.<br />Anyway, enough comparing this watch to the AE. The F91-W is still a great watch and tells me all I need to know at a moment's glance.

Now that I have one of my own, I can attest to its convenience and utility, especially for people who lead active lifestyles. Unlike many other sports watches, this one isn't overly bulky or heavy; whether I'm doing laps on the track or cleans in the gym, this watch isn't a hindrance to my movement in any way. The watch is also very simple: setting it up takes only a few minutes; the buttons and their respective functions are very intuitive; I personally love the stopwatch and alarm function the most, as they help me organize my workouts and my day respectively. The resin strap is also very comfortable, unlike some metal straps that are chilly and hard to the touch. The strap, being both flexible and sturdy, feels comfortable on the skin, so much so that I literally never take this watch off (because I don't have to). I'm so incredibly happy that I put in the money to buy this watch; as of this review, even though I've only had it for a few weeks, I love it to bits and will definitely recommend to others.",[],B000GAWSDG,B09TXZHKLG,AFUENFHX5UAOYGREAMRTHUAJKHGA,2016-10-19 21:49:35.000,0,True

2239003,4,"Classic, quality, and great for the price","This is a wonderful watch and definitely a classic. This was one of the first of its kind and massively popular. Over time the price has decreased now it is one of the best deals there is in terms of watches.<br /><br />Pros<br />-Price. For what you pay, this watch is just fantastic and very solid. This is a military approved watch that can take a beating, and is nice for everyday use or athletic/work use.<br />-Weight. This watch notably lighter than others, and this has its ups and it's downs, but it makes it nice because it is not a sinfully watch weighing on your wrist. Personally, I like big faced watches, but this is a nice change.<br />-Functions. On the default, there is obviously the time (with seconds), as well as the day, date, and ability to change whether it is in 12 or 24 hour format. You can toggle through to find alarm and stopwatch mode. You can set an alarm to go off at any time of the day, as well as set the hourly alarm so the watch beeps every hour on the hour. This can be a handy function when at school, work, homework, etc. when time management is important.<br />-Durability. Though it is no G-Shock (which I highly reccomend because they are great watches), it is nice and pretty durable as well. It is obviously water resistant, so swimming, showering, wearing in rain, etc. with this watch is no problem. Despite it's small size, it feels fairly sturdy and is fine to wear in tough conditions.<br />-Battery life. Though I have not come close to reaching the time for a battery change, I have learned from research as well as friends who have the watch that the battery lasts forever, which is wonderful but not exactly surprising. Since the watch is so small and simple, and it is digital, the battery on this rather than lasting the average 2-3 years, should last more like 5-10 years, which is fantastic.<br /><br />Cons<br />-Size. The first thing I noticed upon unboxing this watch was that it was noticeably smaller than I had expected. While I knew it was not a large faced watch, the face was smaller than it appeared to me on Amazon. I have gotten used to it but this is something to note if size matters much to you.<br />-Strap. The strap on this watch is decent, but by no means impressive. It is pretty thin and not one of the nicest looking bands Casio makes. It does the job and seems strong enough, though over time that may change. Fortunately, that is why you can purchase replacement and different bands for it! With the right tools they are changeable; you can do this is at most watch or jewlery shops.<br />-Buttons. The buttons are pretty small and not always easy to press. While the locations of them is pretty standard, they are small and not always the easiest to access.<br />-Appearance. Though it is a classic, that does not neccesarily mean that it looks professional or very high quality. It does not look bad, especially for the average person looking for an everyday watch or a sports watch, but for someone wanting to look professional, I think it goes without saying that this may not be the watch for you.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great watch and definitely worth the $9 or $10!

2239065,5,Decent watch,"As a watch, this is totally fine. It's affordable, it keeps good time, it has decent features and a long battery life.<br /><br />The problem is the backlight... or rather, the lack of one.

You'll know it's 8-something, but don't expect to know whether it's 8:25 or 8:55.<br /><br />Nevertheless, this would be a forgivable flaw if this were the best Casio could do. But that's not the case. Casio also makes the F105W-1A Illuminator, whose electroluminescent backlight illuminates the entire display with an even blue glow. Given that the F105 is roughly the same price as the F91, there's no reason to prefer the F91, except for maybe nostalgia.<br /><br />2020-01-13 Update<br /><br />After actually using this watch in the dark a bit, I've found that the backlight is actually adequate, so I'm bumping up my review to 5 stars.

2239075,4,Great Simple Budget Watch,"Overall this is a very good watch. I would probably be willing to pay $25, so for $10, it's an awesome deal. My first impression was that it's a little bit smaller than I was thinking. It wasn't so small that it was a problem though, and I actually came to like it later on. One problem with it being small is that it ends up slightly offset on my wrist when I have to use the hole for a larger wrist. That wasn't a huge issue though. One thing that I didn't like is that the light button also serves other functions in some modes, which can make it hard to use in the dark. That's another thing that I got used to and didn't mind later. It is definitely waterproof; it works fine for swimming, I never did try showering though. I do have to say though, don't mess with the screws. I unscrewed the back, just cause I like to look at what's inside things.

After a few minutes in the surf the screen came up with some default screen that had &#34;CASio&#34; written on it (using numbers), and then screen completely died.  I have seen others write that you cannot hit buttons while wet and I am not sure if did that or not.  For the $9 or $10 dollars I am going to give it another shot because I loved this thing.<br /><br />The screen has come back to life, but I can't seem to set the time without the watch blinking in and out.  Maybe a bit more drying off and it will work again.",[],B000GAWSDG,B09TXZHKLG,AGHTXBB7FJP2LXB4AKFDEYEWU67A,2017-08-08 04:15:06.468,0,True

If you are highly forgetful like me, neglecting to remove the watch during showers or swimming, you won’t find yourself needing to buy a new watch! In terms of chronograph function, you can expect to always look down to your wrist for an accurate time, without needing frequent resets as some watches do. A stop watch with lap timer is included, which is excellent for running and other applications. An alarm setting is also present to always keep you on schedule. One of the most useful functions is that the day and date are displayed in addition to the time on the main screen. This is incredibly convenient in date keeping at work or on the go. Beyond this, maintenance is very straightforward. Battery changing is not necessary with an incredible life span, and simple functions like changing the hour during daylight savings time takes only a few total clicks to perform.<br /><br />I recently purchased my second Casio F-91W Digital Sports Watch. I purchased my first during Air Force basic military training approximately 4 years ago. The watch component itself still functions on my old watch after all this time, but after about 3 and a half years of daily heavy use the resin strap broke at one of the seams. The wrist strap is replaceable as well, so you may choose to go that route. If you are a thrifty shopper, a price tag of less than $10 is definitely appealing, especially for a watch whose performance for regular, everyday use rivals that of $100 G-Shock watches that Casio also manufactures.<br /><br /> If you are looking for a reliable, durable, and convenient watch, this is your best bet in a watch, dollar for dollar!",[],B000GAWSDG,B09TXZHKLG,AH3VW3GDMLWQJNEXIJ6NWYG56W3A,2017-02-12 20:09:45.000,0,False

2239459,5,Gains 1 second per week,"If you can buy such a watch for ten bucks, than an eleven dollar watch is pure indulgence.<br /><br />I am deeply impressed with what Casio can do with so little. This watch is petite, nicely presented in an unassuming way, and surprisingly accurate. Your initial impression will be one of dinkiness, thin strap, semi-flat good quality black resin, with the now classical 80's retro wordy techno-babble Casio face. Lovely.<br /><br />It took 3 days of carefully eyeballing time.gov before I could assert that the watch was gaining, and now I can state definitely that it is less than 1 second per week.<br /><br />The only genuine weakness is the backlight. It lights from the left, so you have a fair chance of catching the hour, possibly the minute (with difficulty). Seconds, or the date, not so much. A truly darkened room helps. A movie theater is the worst case, your eyes are lit by the bright screen but the room itself is unlit. Just enjoy the movie, OK?<br /><br />Petite, yes. My wife ridicules it as &#34;a teenager's watch&#34;, and it is certainly small enough for a woman to wear. It looks like the F105W might be slightly bigger but with the same movement. In fact I spent many hours enjoyably clicking through many Casio options, and I think I'll buy some others also. There is a real pleasure of ownership here. For the price of a real watch, you could buy just about the whole catalog.<br /><br />So you could get an atomic radio watch, and improve the accuracy by about half a minute a year, or 15 seconds between DST changes. You could get solar, which would extend the already-superfluous 7 year battery life. Which is not to say that I don't have the red mist for an exquisite sapphire crystal all-everything timepiece like a Citizen Blue Angels or Oceanus. But these are wrist jewelry with technology in search of a problem. I will buy one, some day.

When I wear it it's on 24/7 in the shower and work for long periods. I've worn it on a deployment in the desert and it hasn't let me down. The backlight is ok, I personally don't think its as bad as people say. It allows you to read the time in the dark. The band has held up so far. Oh and it keeps excellent time. Many would opt to throw it out when it breaks but ill replace the battery and maybe put it on a NATO strap.

2239597,4,Good quality for a good price!,"I have been using this watch for around 5 months now, in adverse and harsh conditions, and this watch is doing phenomenally well! I believe it is rated as being &#34;water resistant&#34;, and it certainly is. I have fully submerged the watch multiple times, it is frequently exposed to running tap water, it is hit hard against steel, banged up against concrete, and it keeps perfect time and is still fully functional. It has a few good scratches on it now, but that is to be expected of any watch that is put through what I've put this one through. Outstanding little watch, especially for the price! Now, it isn't perfect. The button that switches the time display modes (switches from 1:45 to 13:45) keeps unintentionally getting pressed so that the time is displayed in the &#34;24 hour&#34; mode. Not a big deal, I just prefer the other mode. Also, this is not a fancy looking watch. It is very basic, and dare I say, cheap looking. Again, a minor thing.<br /><br />All in all, I love this watch, I wear it every day and I'm almost lost without it. Never wore a watch before this one. I constantly check it for the time and the date. It also has a stop watch feature and an alarm. I never use either, so I am unable to comment further on those features. And it has a good sized display (I can still read it a couple of feet away without my glasses).

And I am glancing at the phone at work less.<br /><br />This watch works well with casual apparel, but I also got the Casio a158w when I feel more like a fancy man and need to dress up a little. It is also cheap and also FINE.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81BXcNNvX-L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81BXcNNvX-L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81BXcNNvX-L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B000GAWSDG,B09TXZHKLG,AGMX5KDTPVK5RCPGRLDCHO46KOFA,2021-01-30 18:27:03.985,1,True

2239732,5,Once and future icon,"The fact that you're even looking at an online listing for this watch, which was first released approximately 30 years ago, should say all you need to know. It's simple, it wears so comfortably you'd be forgiven if you forgot it was there, and it looks timeless. Simple to use buttons, very easy to read display, and great build quality for what you pay for this watch.<br /><br />There are only two downsides to this watch that affected me in my daily life, and one can be fixed if you have the technical know-how:<br /><br />1. No countdown timer: this one is the only feature I truly missed in this watch having last worn more contemporary Casio digital offerings. The stopwatch works wonderfully, and the daily alarm and hourly signal get your attention, but it would be nice to be able to set a several minute or hour timer. That being said, we do live in the 21st century, so if you have a smartphone this is all moot.<br /><br />2. The light: one aspect that has unfortunately remained basically unchanged since the 1990s is the illumination on this light. A barely visible green LED off to the left of the LCD panel. Running this watch stock it's difficult to read in anything other than bright light or total darkness. However, if you trust your soldering skills it's quite easy to replace this LED with an ultra bright 1206/0805 size replacement of any color you want. I've done this about a half dozen times now and it never gets old seeing this legendary watch light up like a small flashlight.<br /><br />Overall would highly recommend, either as a beater watch, a first watch for a child, or a watch to practice tinkering and modding.",[],B000GAWSDG,B09TXZHKLG,AGMG5LOYA4FEGTS4AVYFB26W6H2Q,2020-10-19 16:37:04.210,0,True

I'm not sure how water resistant it really is, but it had no trouble being submerged a little in a lake for a bit. The band is comfortable, but not breathable (obviously).<br /><br />I think my complaint with this watch is the light button is not good. I really wish there was a separate button just for the light. Setting the alarm in the dark was very annoying since you can't *just* press the light button sometimes. I haven't had to use the stopwatch feature in the dark either, but I can imagine that is a big pain. The light is just pretty bad in general too. It's just a dinky LED off on one side that doesn't evenly illuminate the watch face.

2239741,5,"An excellent choice if you value a slim, lightweight watch","The F-91W has a couple of advantages over its bigger G-Shock relatives like the DW-5600E. Its tiny case size and weight make it easy to forget you're wearing. For small to average wrists, this watch should wear just fine. It will be too small for an 8 inch wrist or larger. The 8mm thick case will easily slip under long sleeved shirts and jackets when many G-Shocks won't. It's also tough enough for probably 95% of people. I haven't managed to to break the watch and it survives lap swimming with no problems (even when its not rated for that at all.) But on the other side, the G-Shocks are rated for far better shock and water resistance and the materials quality are much better (and you'll notice immediately when you handle them.) You will get what you pay for.<br /><br />The buttons are exposed on the side and that makes them extremely easy to operate. Once you memorize the layout, it's extremely easy to set a quick alarm and switch the hourly chime on/off. If you prefer 12/24 hour time in airports or train stations, you can easily switch with one button press. The alarm volume is actually pretty decent as well. It's not going to wake a really heavy sleeper, but it's louder than most G-Shock models. Test it and see if it's loud enough to wake you at home before relying on it in travel situations.<br /><br />A lot of people complain about the small, weak micro LED light. I get that. But it's a compromise that keeps the case thin at 8mm. When you use the improved full-screen LED illuminator or EL backlight tech, the thickness of the watch has to increase. But the micro LED light actually does its job pretty well in actual darkness. Even if your eyes aren't adjusted to the dark, you can easily see hours and minutes with it. But if a bright light is important to you, spend a little more for the slightly bigger F-105W.<br /><br />The watch's weakest aspect is the band. The resin is cheaper than a G-Shock and it lacks the curved lugs that help it wrap around the wrist. Chlorinated water from pools, sweat, and salt water will all weaken the resin over time. Over-tightening the band will stress it more too. To make the band last longer, rinse sweat and salt off the band and dry it at the end of the day, and wear it loose enough to fit one finger between the band and your wrist.<br /><br />All-in-all though, the F-91W is an absolute winner if watch thinness and alarm/hourly chime are important to you. Highly recommended.",[],B000GAWSDG,B09TXZHKLG,AHVOC5R2LRX7OGMHZWCESPR4KQBA,2022-02-22 17:06:54.050,1,True

The band has held up, the alarm always works, the watch is easy to set, military time is included, date and week day is displayed, it can be set to beep on the hour, it has proven to be water resistant as advertised(this is no diving watch, but holds up fine to showers and washing hands, etc). Really the only thing which could be better is the watch face illumination(a single green led which illuminates the screen about 3/4 full). It's adequate for checking the time in bed or late at night outdoors, but not much else. To be honest, it's not that much of a problem, but it has to be mentioned. I would not reccomend this watch for those with a large wrist, as it will look quite small(I have a smaller than average wrist, but choose to wear it reversed facing me). I have found it to be very comfortable, as it's light weight and small size is very unobtrusive(when I take it off, I find myself looking at my wrist only to be confused when it's not there).<br />tl,dr: It's retro and minimalist, if that fits your bill then don't hesitate to pick one up.

Did you borrow that watch from you 10 year old son? It’s so small and cheap looking. I didn’t think you ever knew how to read a LCD display.<br /><br />Casio F-91W Owner: It’s a Casio F-91W, and no I didn’t borrow it from my son, but sometimes I let him borrow it from me. I know that I typically, prefer analogue watches with a mechanical or automatic movements. I did need to read the instruction manual I figure out how to read the digital display. Once I figured out that the colon on the display is separating the hours (on the left) from the minute (on the right) and the smaller numbers on the far right represent the seconds; it’s actual easier to read that the 3 hand analogues.<br /><br />Co-work: So, why did you buy this watch? It doesn’t seem to fit in with your Seiko 5, Orient, HMT, Citizen Eco-drive or that Chinese knock-off of an expensive German watch you can’t afford, that you typically wear to the office.<br /><br />Casio F-91W Owner: It’s nothing like my other watches, but this watch is one of the great classics. This model was first made in 1991, and was the smart watch of its time. The features and price-point is also unbeatable. I got it specifically because I am going on vacation to the beach and I wanted an affordable watch to wear of the beach and in the pool. This is proven technology; this model has been manufacture for over two decades and it’s almost bombproof.<br /><br />Co-work: Doesn’t WR mean Water Resistant; like splash and rain resistant only. I thought you need at least a 50m or 100m rating to take it swimming.<br /><br />Casio F-91W Owner: You are completely correct, and completely wrong. A watch worth worrying about needs at least a 50m or preferable a 100m rating just for swimming on the surface more or less. Personally, I wouldn’t take any of my other watches swimming on purpose, even though some of them have a 100m rating. However, this Casio is very modest in cost and I consider the manufactures water resistance rating is very under stated. Sure, if I ruin this watch swimming, the manufacture going to tell me to fly a kite, if I made a warranty claim, but this is a ten dollar watch. If you have ten dollars to wager, like I do, throw caution to the wind or perhaps dive in head first with it. It’s a lot like jaywalking, it’s not recommended, but you not trueing living your life to the fullest if you follow every rule. I sure a G-Shock with 200m water rating is manufacture with more seals and offers better water protection, but I also think that the water resistance rating is partially just marketing to separate Casio’s $10 watches from their $100 watches. I’ve taken this watch in the ocean and dove in swimming pools with no problems.  I’d recommend not pressing the buttons when it’s wet, as well as not being a cry baby if you ruin it, but this watch is suitable for swimming in my book.<br /><br />Co-work: Wow, what a risk taker, they must be paying you too much, if you have ten bucks to risk like that. So you say it’s was the smart watch of its time back in the day.  What’s so smart about this watch?<br /><br />Casio F-91W Owner: Well for starters, a day-date complication with annual calendar, that only needs to be corrected for leap years.  It switches between AM/PM and 24 hour format with a single push of a button. It has a hourly repeater that can be turned on and off. A stopwatch function, and am alarm.  Did I mention it has a very dim light, and I believe it was y2k compliant nearly a decade in advance.<br /><br />Co-work: Wow, I think my iwatch can do all that, but I don’t know how to. I also paid a lot more than you, and I can’t take it swimming. How about battery life? Where’s the charger plug? Is it self-winding, like you Seiko 5, and going to die after a few days off your wrist? I know for sure that in 1991 there was no such thing as wireless charging.<br /><br />Casio F-91W Owner: It’s much for low tech then wireless charging, or self-winding. It’s powered by a replaceable battery. Casio claims 7-years on a single battery with no daily recharging required.  It’s more likely that the strap will break, before the battery will need to be replaced. It doesn’t need any sunlight either, some people claim to get 10 years on a single battery, it really depends on how frequent the light and alarm functions are utilized. In theory you could hide out in a cave for years without worrying about charging or replacing the battery.<br /><br />Co-work: Hey, one more question. I know you are married, but ascetically speaking, do you think I watch like this would be helpful in attraction women? It’s kind of ugly looking.<br /><br />Casio F-91W Owner: Well my friend, with you ugly face and abrasive personality, if a woman takes the time to look at your watch, she’ll be excited to see a practical watch on your wrist.  Well unless she’s a gold digger type, but you don’t need that.  Any women that can’t appreciate a classic watch like this doesn’t even desire to go dutch at McDonalds with you. However, for you, I’d strongly recommend the Casio CA53W, if you want a line of highly desirable ladies wanting to go out with you.  If you wear a Casio CA53W and a lady starts a conversation about your watch, you’ll need to take her somewhere nice, like a sit-down type restaurant, and pay the whole bill, and she’ll surely want a second date when she see you generously calculate 18% gratuity with your calculator watch.",[],B000GAWSDG,B09TXZHKLG,AE6Y5H5MN7ZDVUXJD4SN6RD3TF3Q,2016-10-10 20:13:39.000,213,True

2293274,4,Great basic watch,What a great watch. Everything about it is great except for the band. I heard that some peoples band would wear out in 2 years and from a review a guy is going on his 11th year without the band breaking on him and he was trying to wear out the watch to see how long he can make it last but failed to do so. My opinion is that the band is fine and can last as long as the watch. But at the price it really dont matter. You can always get a better band and attach it to this watch and have this watch for 7-10 years. Very slim and unnoticable that you have it on. Swim and shower with it. A must buy definetly.

Casio focuses on a few key watch lines that are quickly recognizable and highly desired the world over.

The watch looks as it does in the pictures on Amazon, and brings back old memories. You can't go wrong for the amount it's for sale. Makes a nice watch for kids too (holiday season coming up) due to the fact that the band has so many fitting holes, that it can even fit a kids wrist. It is kind of small (as stated by others), but personally I don't really mind that at all. This is a nice beater watch (a watch you use a bit more careless) and is very thin in size too. I have no idea how long the rubber will hold/last and the same goes for the battery since I've just got it in today. I will however, tell you all to buy this watch without feeling bad about it. It can certainly give you some fun, and it's a very practical device!","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/7114dQe7RzL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/7114dQe7RzL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/7114dQe7RzL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71D0JMmCoXL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71D0JMmCoXL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71D0JMmCoXL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71oQHiZcTeL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71oQHiZcTeL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71oQHiZcTeL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B000GAWSDG,B09TXZHKLG,AFEBS2QRXDBZFJ46SBT3ZPBM2R5Q,2015-10-21 18:28:05.000,4,True

Nothing can kill this gem of a watch. After numerous brushes with walls, metal etc, the only scratch on the surface is really not noticeable. The strap is excellent. No sign of wear and tear yet. The light is sufficient in any dark area.<br /><br />My previous $40 from Timex lasted 1-1/2 years before the strap just rusted away with sweat.

So I looked all over the place for this &lt;i>kind&lt;/i> of watch, which I remember being ubiquitous for years, and &lt;i>cheap-cheap-cheap.&lt;/i> I start looking, and guess what: None of the discount stores don't carry 'em no more. But Casio still makes the original, upon which all the cheapie knockoffs are based...upon. I was looking to spend, what, $5 at most for the dollar store version. But I had no choice and ended up getting the name brand version for about $14. And it works fine, just fine. I don't need the alarm, I haven't used the light yet, I'm not in the military so I don't need the 24-hour format, but those are features that are included. I just needed it to keep accurate time, and that it does. That it does, friend. That it does.<br /><br />That it does.

I'm in the UK forces and I, with countless others wear this watch as it's so reliable and does everything you could want. I've swam with it, dived with it, gone neck deep in mud with it, been in below freezing temperatures for days, got oil on it, scrambled on rocks, covered in grit, in salt water for prolonged periods and yet it still goes on!! The battery life is amazing as well. All my friends agree this is the watch to have. Others have had supposed 'rugged' watches which have broken in half the time. Sure, have a fancy watch for events and going out but this watch cannot be bettered for the working day. the only reason I'm on here buying another is because I lost it after years of it putting up with me. In the 1 in million chance that it does break (or more likely, you lose it) it's only £8.00 to replace. It's unbelievably good. The only thing that could be better is if you could keep the backlight on whilst changing the alarm time, which is a little annoying trying to set an alarm in the pitch black (but I just learnt the sequence of beeps after a while!).",[],B000GAWSDG,B09TXZHKLG,AF2FPIMBSGA7OHXDWRC3IZU6TL5A,2014-12-12 18:13:48.000,0,False

His battery lasted for amazing 7 years! I remember that its strap soon cracked, wich make me stop using it in the wrist, but the watch continued to work for many years. I still have it with me, as some kind of memory. I plain to buy a new strap and replace the battery. I sure I gonna not use it in the wrist.
